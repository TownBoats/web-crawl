{"title": "Specularity Factorization for Low-Light Enhancement", "abstract": "We present a new additive image factorization technique that treats images to be composed of multiple latent specular components which can be simply estimated recursively by modulating the sparsity during decomposition. Our model-driven RSFNet estimates these factors by unrolling the optimization into network layers requiring only a few scalars to be learned. The resultant factors are interpretable by design and can be fused for different image enhancement tasks via a network or combined directly by the user in a controllable fashion. Based on RSFNet, we detail a zero-reference Low Light Enhancement (LLE) application trained without paired or unpaired supervision. Our system improves the state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks and achieves better generalization on multiple other datasets. We also integrate our factors with other task specific fusion networks for applications like deraining, deblurring and dehazlng with negligible overhead thereby highlighting the multi-domain and multi-task generalizability of our proposed RSFNet.

{"title": "A Category Agnostic Model for Visual Rearrangment", "abstract": "This paper presents a novel category agnostic model for visual rearrangement task, which can help an embodied agent to physically recover the shuffled scene configuration without any category concepts to the goal configuration. Previous methods usually follow a similar architecture, completing the rearrangement task by aligning the scene changes of the goal and shuffled configuration, according to the semantic scene graphs. However, constructing scene graphs requires the inference of category labels, which not only causes the accuracy drop of the entire task but also limits the application in real world scenario. In this paper, we delve deep into the essence of visual re-arrangement task and focus on the two most essential issues, scene change detection and scene change matching. We utilize the movement and the protrusion of point cloud to accurately identify the scene changes and match these changes depending on the similarity of category agnostic appearance feature. Moreover, to assist the agent to explore the environment more efficiently and comprehensively, we propose a closer-aligned-retrace exploration policy, aiming to observe more details of the scene at a closer distance. We conduct extensive experiments onAI2THOR Rearrangement Challenge based on RoomR dataset and a new multi-room multi-instance dataset MrMiR collected by us.

{"title": "FlowIE: Efficient Image Enhancement via Rectified Flow", "abstract": "Image enhancement holds extensive applications in real-world scenarios due to complex environments and limitations of imaging devices. Conventional methods are often constrained by their tailored models, resulting in diminished robustness when confronted with challenging degradation conditions. In response, we propose FlowIE, a simple yet highly effective flow-based image enhancement framework that estimates straight-line paths from an elementary distribution to high-quality images. Unlike previous diffusion-based methods that suffer from long-time inference, FlowIE constructs a linear many-to-one transport mapping via conditioned rectified flow. The rectification straightens the trajectories of probability transfer, accelerating inference by an order of magnitude. This design enables our FlowIE to fully exploit rich knowledge in the pretrained diffusion model, rendering it well-suited for various real-world applications. Moreover, we devise a faster inference algorithm, inspired by Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem, harnessing midpoint tangent direction to optimize path estimation, ultimately yielding visually superior results. Thanks to these designs, our FlowIE adeptly manages a diverse range of enhancement tasks within a concise sequence of fewer than 5 steps.

However, current research is prohibitively restricted by the lack of large-scale, real-world, and spatial-temporally aligned event-image datasets. To this end, we propose a real-world (indoor and outdoor) dataset comprising over 30K pairs of images and events under both low and normal illumination conditions. To achieve this, we utilize a robotic arm that traces a consistent non-linear trajectory to curate the dataset with spatial alignment precision under 0.03mm. We then introduce a matching alignment strategy, rendering 90% of our dataset with errors less than 0.01s. Based on the dataset, we propose a novel event-guided LIE approach, called EvLight, towards robust performance in real-world low-light scenes. Specifically, we first design the multiscale holistic fusion branch to extract holistic structural and textural information from both events and images. To ensure robustness against variations in the regional illumination and noise, we then introduce a Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR)-guided regional feature selection to selectively fuse features of images from regions with high SNR and enhance those with low SNR by extracting regional structure information from events. Extensive experiments on our dataset and the synthetic SDSD dataset demonstrate our EvLight significantly surpasses the frame-based methods, e.g., [4] by 1.14 dB and 2.62 dB, respectively.", "keywords": "Fuses, Robot vision systems, Urban areas, Lighting, Feature extraction, Cameras, Trajectory", "authors": "Guoqiang Liang, Kanghao Chen, Hangyu Li, Yunfan Lu, Lin Wang"}

Previous works for ESR often process positive and negative events in a mixed paradigm.

In this paper, we propose a bilateral event mining and complementary network (BMCNet) to fully leverage the potential of each event and capture the shared information to complement each other simultaneously. Specifically, we resort to a two-stream network to accomplish comprehensive mining of each type of events individually. To facilitate the exchange of information between two streams, we propose a bilateral information exchange (BIE) module. This module is layer-wisely embedded between two streams, enabling the effective propagation of hierarchical global information while alleviating the impact of invalid information brought by inherent characteristics of events.

This paper introduces a novel latent diffusion shape-generative model regularized by a quality checker that outputs a score of a latent code. The scoring function employs a learned function that provides a geometric feasibility score and a deterministic procedure to quantify a physical stability score.

This problem is especially challenging for diffuse objects: it is ill-conditioned because diffuse materials severely blur incoming light, and it is ill-posed because diffuse materials under high-frequency lighting can be indistinguishable from shiny materials under low-frequency lighting. We show that it is possible to recover precise materials and illumination-even from diffuse objects-by exploiting un-intended shadows, like the ones cast onto an object by the photographer who moves around it. These shadows are a nuisance in most previous inverse rendering pipelines, but here we exploit them as signals that improve conditioning and help resolve material-lighting ambiguities.

Our research uncovers a surprising relationship between the appearance of chrome balls and the initial diffusion noise map, which we utilize to consistently generate high-quality chrome balls.

Moreover, it requires recovering intricate and complete 3D human shapes from short video sequences, intensifying the level of difficulty. To tackle these challenges, we first define a layered neural representation for the entire scene, composited by individual human and background models. We learn the layered neural representation from videos via our layer-wise differentiable volume rendering. This learning process is further enhanced by our hybrid instance segmentation approach which combines the self-supervised 3D segmentation and the promp table 2D segmentation module, yielding reliable instance segmentation supervision even under close human interaction.

{"title": "URHand: Universal Relightable Hands", "abstract": "Existing photorealistic relightable hand models require extensive identity-specific observations in different views, poses, and illuminations, and face challenges in generalizing to natural illuminations and novel identities. To bridge this gap, we present URHand, the first universal relightable hand model that generalizes across viewpoints, poses, illuminations, and identities. Our model allows few-shot personalization using images captured with a mobile phone, and is ready to be photorealistically rendered under novel illuminations. To simplify the personalization process while retaining photorealism, we build a powerful universal relightable prior based on neural relighting from multi-view images of hands captured in a light stage with hundreds of identities. The key challenge is scaling the cross-identity training while maintaining personalized fidelity and sharp details without compromising generalization under natural illuminations. To this end, we propose a spatially varying linear lighting model as the neural renderer that takes physics-inspired shading as input feature. By removing non-linear activations and bias, our specifically designed lighting model explicitly keeps the linearity of light transport. This enables single-stage training from light-stage data while generalizing to real-time rendering under arbitrary continuous illuminations across diverse identities. In addition, we introduce the joint learning of a physically based model and our neural relighting model, which further improves fidelity and generalization.

However, current methods still face challenges when used in industrial applications due to unstable results, low-quality meshes, and a lack of UV unwrapping and skinning weights. In this paper, we present SHERT, a novel pipeline that can reconstruct semantic human meshes with textures and high-precision details. SHERT applies semantic- and normal-based sampling between the detailed surface (e.g. mesh and SDF) and the corresponding SMPL-X model to obtain a partially sampled semantic mesh and then generates the complete semantic mesh by our specifically designed self-supervised completion and refinement networks. Using the complete semantic mesh as a basis, we employ a texture diffusion model to create human textures that are driven by both images and texts. Our reconstructed meshes have stable UV unwrapping, high-quality triangle meshes, and consistent semantic information. The given SMPL-X model provides semantic information and shape priors, allowing SHERT to perform well even with incorrect and incomplete inputs.

In this paper, we explore the use of implicit 3-D body shape representations as pixel-level guidance to augment the extraction of identity features with body shape knowledge, in addition to appearance. Using body shape as supervision, rather than as input, provides shapeaware enhancements without any increase in computational cost and delivers coherent integration with pixel-wise appearance features.

Furthermore, most prior works of DG for FAS do not ensure convergence to a local flat minimum, which has been shown to be advantageous for DG. In this paper, we introduce GAC-FAS, a novel learning objective that encourages the model to converge towards an optimal flat minimum without necessitating additional learning modules. Unlike conventional sharpness-aware minimizers, GAC-FAS identifies ascending points for each domain and regulates the generalization gradient updates at these points to align coherently with empirical risk minimization (ERM) gradient updates.

With ad-vancements in sensor manufacture and multi-modal learning techniques, many multi-modal FAS approaches have emerged.

RPE, however, can only inject the model with prior knowledge that nearby pixels are more important than far pixels. Keypoint RPE (KP-RPE) is an extension of this principle, where the significance of pixels is not solely dictated by their proximity but also by their relative positions to specific keypoints within the image. By anchoring the significance of pixels around keypoints, the model can more effectively retain spatial relationships, even when those relationships are disrupted by affine transformations. We show the merit of KP-RPE inface and gait recognition. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness in improving face recognition performance from low-quality images, particularly where alignment is prone to failure.

{"title": "Flexible Biometrics Recognition: Bridging the Multimodality Gap Through Attention, Alignment and Prompt Tuning", "abstract": "Periocular and face are complementary biometrics for identity management, albeit with inherent limitations, notably in scenarios involving occlusion due to sunglasses or masks. In response to these challenges, we introduce Flexible Biometric Recognition (FBR), a novel framework designed to advance conventional face, periocular, and multimodal face-periocular biometrics across both intra- and cross-modality recognition tasks. FBR strategically utilizes the Multimodal Fusion Attention (MFA) and Multimodal Prompt Tuning (MPT) mechanisms within the Vision Transformer architecture. MFA facilitates the fusion of modalities, ensuring cohesive alignment between facial and periocular embeddings while incorporating soft-biometrics to enhance the model's ability to discriminate between individuals. The fusion of three modalities is pivotal in exploring interrelationships between different modalities. Additionally, MPT serves as a unifying bridge, intertwining inputs and promoting cross-modality interactions while preserving their distinctive characteristics. The collaborative synergy of MFA and MPT enhances the shared features of the face and periocular, with a specific emphasis on the ocular region, yielding exceptional performance in both intra-and cross-modality recognition tasks. Rigorous experimentation across four benchmark datasets validates the note-worthy performance of the FBR model.

{"title": "One-Class Face Anti-Spoofing via Spoof Cue Map-Guided Feature Learning", "abstract": "Many face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have focused on learning discriminative features from both live and spoof training data to strengthen the security of face recognition systems. However, since not every possible attack type is available in the training stage, these FAS methods usually fail to detect unseen attacks in the inference stage. In comparison, one-class FAS, where training data comprise only live faces, aims to detect whether a test face image belongs to the live class or not. In this paper, we propose a novel One-Class Spoof Cue Map estimation Network (OC-SCMNet) to address the one-class FAS detection problem. Our first goal is to learn to extract latent spoof features from live images so that their estimated Spoof Cue Maps (SCMs) should have zero responses. To avoid trapping to a trivial solution, we devise a novel SCM-guided feature learning by combining many SCMs as pseudo ground-truths to guide a conditional generator to create latent spoof features for spoof data. Our second goal is to simulate the potential out-of-distribution spoof attacks approximately. To this end, we propose using a memory bank to dynamically preserve a set of sufficiently “independent” latent spoof features to encourage the generator to probe the latent spoof feature space. Extensive experiments conducted on eight FAS benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed OC-SCMNet not only outperforms previous one-class FAS approaches but also achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art two-class FAS methods.

Recognizable identity features within the image are encouraged by co-training a recognition model on its high-dimensional feature represen-tation. To enhance privacy, the high-dimensional represen-tation is crafted through random channel shuffling, resulting in randomized recognizable images devoid of attacker-leverageable texture details.

In many real-world scenarios, the labeled molecules are limited in quantity or laborious to derive. Recent pseudo-labeling methods are usually designed based on a single domain knowledge, thereby failing to understand the comprehensive molecular configurations and limiting their adaptability to generalize across diverse biochemical context. To this end, we introduce an innovative paradigm for dealing with the molecule pseudo-labeling, named as Molecular Data Programming (MDP). In particular, we adopt systematic supervision sources via crafting multiple graph labeling functions, which covers various molecular structural knowledge of graph kernels, molecular fingerprints, and topological features. Each of them creates an uncertain and biased labels for the unlabeled molecules. To address the decision conflicts among the diverse pseudo-labels, we design a label synchronizer to differentiably model confidences and correlations between the labeling functions, which yields probabilistic molecular labels to adapt for specific applications. These probabilistic molecular labels are used to train a molecular classifier for improving its generalization capability. On eight bench-mark datasets, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of MDP on the weakly supervised molecule classification tasks, achieving an average improvement of 9.5%.

Our framework treats a protein as a graph, where each node represents an amino acid and each edge represents a spatial or sequential connection between amino acids. We then apply an iterative clustering strategy to group the nodes into clusters based on their 1D and 3D positions and assign scores to each cluster. We select the highest-scoring clusters and use their medoid nodes for the next iteration of clustering, until we obtain a hierarchical and informative representation of the protein. We evaluate on four protein-related tasks: protein fold classification, enzyme reaction classification, gene ontology term prediction, and enzyme commission number prediction.

In this work, we present a unifying formalism for PCA and its variants, and introduce a framework based on the flags of linear subspaces, i.e. a hierarchy of nested linear subspaces of increasing dimension, which not only allows for a common implementation but also yields novel variants, not explored previously. We begin by generalizing traditional PCA methods that either maximize variance or minimize reconstruction error. We expand these interpre-tations to develop a wide array of new dimensionality re-duction algorithms by accounting for outliers and the data manifold. To devise a common computational approach, we recast robust and dual forms of peA as optimization problems on flag manifolds. We then integrate tangent space approximations of principal geodesic analysis (tangent-PCA) into this flag-based framework, creating novel robust and dual geodesic PCA variations. The remarkable flexibility offered by the ‘flagification’ introduced here enables even more algorithmic variants identified by specific flag types.

{"title": "CAM Back Again: Large Kernel CNNs from a Weakly Supervised Object Localization Perspective", "abstract": "Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with large size kernels have attracted much attention in the computer vision field, following the success of the Vision Transformers. Large kernel CNNs have been reported to perform well in downstream vision tasks as well as in classification performance. The reason for the high performance of large kernel CNNs in downstream tasks has been attributed to the large effective receptive field (ERF) produced by large size kernels, but this view has not been fully tested. We therefore revisit the performance of large kernel CNNs in downstream task, focusing on the weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) task. WSOL, a difficult downstream task that is not fully supervised, provides a new angle to explore the capabilities of the large kernel CNNs. Our study compares the modern large kernel CNNs ConvNeXt, RepLKNet, and SLaK to test the validity of the naive expectation that ERF size is important for improving downstream task performance. Our analysis of the factors contributing to high performance provides a different perspective, in which the main factor is feature map improvement. Furthermore, we find that modern CNNs are robust to the CAM problems of local regions of objects being activated, which has long been discussed in WSOL. CAM is the most classic WSOL method, but because of the above-mentioned problems, it is often used as a baseline method for comparison. However, experiments on the CUB-200-2011 dataset show that simply combining a large kernel CNN, CAM, and simple data augmentation methods can achieve performance (90.99% MaxBoxAcc) comparable to the latest WSOL method, which is CNN-based and requires special training or complex post-processing.", "keywords": "Training, Location awareness, Computer vision, Systematics, Computer architecture, Transformers, Pattern recognition", "authors": "Shunsuke Yasuki, Masato Taki"}

{"title": "Quantifying Task Priority for Multi-Task Optimization", "abstract": "The goal of multi-task learning is to learn diverse tasks within a single unified network. As each task has its own unique objective function, conflicts emerge during training, resulting in negative transfer among them. Earlier research identified these conflicting gradients in shared parameters between tasks and attempted to realign them in the same direction. However, we prove that such optimization strategies lead to sub-optimal Pareto solutions due to their inability to accurately determine the individual contributions of each parameter across various tasks. In this paper, we propose the concept of task priority to evaluate parameter contributions across different tasks. To learn task priority, we identify the type of connections related to links between parameters influenced by task-specific losses during backpropagation. The strength of connections is gauged by the magnitude of parameters to determine task priority. Based on these, we present a new method named connection strength-based optimization for multi-task learning which consists of two phases. The first phase learns the task priority within the network, while the second phase modifies the gradients while upholding this priority. This ultimately leads to finding new Pareto optimal solutions for multiple tasks.

In this paper, we present a novel formulation for conic-based calibration using moments. Our derivation is based on the mathematical finding that the first moment can be estimated without bias even under dis-tortion. This allows us to track moment changes during pro-jection and distortion, ensuring the preservation of the first moment of the distorted conic.

In this paper, we demonstrate a novel approach that, for the first time, bypasses the second stage. Specifically, we show that it is possible to directly estimate the correct relative camera pose from correspondences without needing a post-processing step to enforce the cheirality constraint on the correspondences. Building on recent advances in certifiable non-minimal optimization, we frame the relative pose estimation as a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP).

Utilizing 3D Gaussians for animated humans brings new challenges, including the artifacts created when articulating the Gaussians. We propose to jointly optimize the linear blend skinning weights to coordinate the movements of individual Gaussians during animation. Our approach enables novel-pose synthesis of human and novel view synthesis of both the human and the scene.

Moreover, previous efforts often study this task from the perspective of the whole human body, neglecting fine-grained guidance hidden in different body parts. To this end, we present a new Fine-Grained Prompt-Driven Denoiser based on a diffusion model for 3D HPE, named FinePOSE. It consists of three core blocks enhancing the reverse process of the diffusion model: (1) Fine-grained Part-aware Prompt learning (FPP) block constructs fine-grained part-aware prompts via coupling accessible texts and naturally feasible knowledge of body parts with learnable prompts to model implicit guidance. (2) Fine-grained Prompt-pose Communication (FPC) block establishes fine-grained communications between learned part-aware prompts and poses to improve the denoising quality. (3) Prompt-driven Timestamp Stylization (PTS) block integrates learned prompt embedding and temporal information related to the noise level to enable adaptive adjustment at each denoising step. Extensive experiments on public single-human pose estimation datasets show that FinePOSE outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We further extend FinePOSE to multi-human pose estimation.

{"title": "Learning Visual Prompt for Gait Recognition", "abstract": "Gait, a prevalent and complex form of human motion, plays a significant role in the field of long-range pedestrian retrieval due to the unique characteristics inherent in individual motion patterns. However, gait recognition in real-world scenarios is challenging due to the limitations of capturing comprehensive cross-viewing and crossclothing data. Additionally, distractors such as occlusions, directional changes, and lingering movements further complicate the problem. The widespread application of deep learning techniques has led to the development of various potential gait recognition methods. However, these methods utilize convolutional networks to extract shared information across different views and attire conditions. Once trained, the parameters and non-linear function become constrained to fixed patterns, limiting their adaptability to various distractors in real-world scenarios.

However, the high computational costs of these video pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present a plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering framework, called Hourglass Tokenizer (HoT), for efficient transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. Our HoT begins with pruning pose tokens of re-dundant frames and ends with recovering full-length tokens, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. To effectively achieve this, we propose a token pruning cluster (TPC) that dynamically selects a few representative tokens with high semantic diversity while eliminating the redundancy of video frames. In addition, we develop a token recovering attention (TRA) to restore the detailed spatio-temporal information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference.

In this paper, we extend the ability of controllable generative models for a more comprehensive hand mesh recovery task: di-rect hand mesh generation, inpainting, reconstruction, and fitting in a single framework, which we name as Holistic Hand Mesh Recovery (HHMR). Our key observation is that different kinds of hand mesh recovery tasks can be achieved by a single generative model with strong multimodal con-trollability, and in such a framework, realizing different tasks only requires giving different signals as conditions. To achieve this goal, we propose an all-in-one diffusion frame-work based on graph convolution and attention mechanisms for holistic hand mesh recovery. In order to achieve strong control generation capability while ensuring the decoupling of multimodal control signals, we map different modalities to a shared feature space and apply cross-scale random masking in both modality and feature levels. In this way, the correlation between different modalities can be fully exploited during the learning of hand priors. Furthermore, we propose Condition-aligned Gradient Guidance to enhance the alignment of the generated model with the control sig-nals, which significantly improves the accuracy of the hand mesh reconstruction and fitting.

{"title": "Capturing Closely Interacted Two-Person Motions with Reaction Priors", "abstract": "In this paper, we focus on capturing closely interacted two-person motions from monocular videos, an important yet understudied topic. Unlike less-interacted motions, closely interacted motions contain frequently occurring inter-human occlusions, which pose significant challenges to existing capturing algorithms. To address this problem, our key observation is that close physical interactions between two subjects typically happen under very specific situations (e.g., handshake, hug, etc.), and such situational contexts contain strong prior semantics to help infer the poses of occluded joints. In this spirit, we introduce reaction priors, which are invertible neural networks that bi-directionally model the pose probability distributions of one person given the pose of the other. The learned reaction priors are then incorporated into a query-based pose estimator, which is a decoder-only Transformer with self-attentions on both intra-joint and inter-joint relationships. We demonstrate that our design achieves considerably higher performance than previous methods on multiple benchmarks. What's more, as existing datasets lack sufficient cases of close human-human interactions, we also build a new dataset called Dual-Human to better evaluate different methods. Dual-Human contains around 2k sequences of closely interacted two-person motions, each with synthetic multi-view renderings, contact annotations, and text descriptions.

Traditional Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) struggle to maintain consistent facial identity, while Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods, although they can address this issue, often produce mismatched lip movements, inadequate facial expressions, and unstable head poses. A lifelike talking head requires synchronized coordination of subject identity, lip movements, facial expression, and head poses. The absence of these synchronizations is a fundamental flaw, leading to unrealistic and artificial outcomes. To address the critical issue of synchronization, identified as the “devil” in creating realistic talking heads, we introduce SyncTalk. This NeRF-based method effectively maintains subject identity, enhancing synchronization and realism in talking head synthesis. SyncTalk employs a Face-Sync Controller to align lip movements with speech and innovatively uses a 3D facial blendshape model to capture accurate facial expressions. Our Head-Sync Stabilizer optimizes head poses, achieving more natural head movements.

The majority of existing estimation methods still rely on single-view images as input, leading to potential limitations, e.g., limited field-of-view and ambiguity in depth. To address these problems, adding another camera to better capture the shape of hands is a practi-cal direction. However, existing multi-view hand pose estimation methods suffer from two main drawbacks: 1) Re-quiring multi-view annotations for training, which are ex-pensive. 2) During testing, the model becomes inapplica-ble if camera parameters/layout are not the same as those used in training. In this paper, we propose a novel Single-to-Dual-view adaptation (S2DHand) solution that adapts a pretrained single-view estimator to dual views.

Specifically, S2DHand is built on certain stereo constraints, including pairwise cross-view consensus and invariance of transformation between both views. These two stereo constraints are used in a complementary manner to gen-erate pseudo-labels, allowing reliable adaptation.

Recently, diffusion models have showcased remarkable generative abilities across various domains. They hold promise for human motion generation due to their adaptable many-to-many nature. Nonetheless, current diffusion-based motion generation models often create entire motion sequences directly and unidirectionally, lacking focus on the motion with local and bidirectional enhancement. When choreographing high-quality dance movements, people need to take into account not only the musical context but also the nearby music-aligned dance motions. To authentically capture human behavior, we propose a Bidirectional Autoregressive Diffusion Model (BADM) for music-to-dance generation, where a bidirectional encoder is built to enforce that the generated dance is harmonious in both the forward and backward directions. To make the generated dance motion smoother, a local information decoder is built for local motion enhancement. The proposed framework is able to generate new motions based on the input conditions and nearby motions, which foresees individual motion slices iteratively and con-solidates all predictions. To further refine the synchronicity between the generated dance and the beat, the beat information is incorporated as an input to generate better music-aligned dance movements.

Recent pedestrian animation frameworks have a significant limitation wherein they primarily focus on either following trajectory [48] or the content of the reference video [60], consequently overlooking the potential diversity of human motion within such scenarios. This limitation restricts the ability to generate pedestrian behaviors that exhibit a wider range of variations and realistic motions and therefore re-stricts its usage to provide rich motion content for other components in the driving simulation system, e.g., suddenly changed motion to which the autonomous vehicle should respond. In our approach, we strive to surpass the limitation by showcasing diverse human motions obtained from various sources, such as generated human motions, in ad-dition to following the given trajectory.

Language-Based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction", "abstract": "Language models have demonstrated impressive ability in context understanding and generative performance. Inspired by the recent success of language foundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal Trajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort of question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression models, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals, we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural language space. Here, the entire timeseries trajectories of pedestrians are converted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language model. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning high-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between pedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model. Lastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of the question-answer prompts. Here, we propose a beam-search-based most-likely prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj, we show that the language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods. Extensive experiments show that our LMTraj can successfully understand social relationships and accurately extrapolate the multimodal futures on the public pedestrian trajectory prediction benchmark.

{"title": "3D Human Pose Perception from Egocentric Stereo Videos", "abstract": "While head-mounted devices are becoming more compact, they provide egocentric views with significant self-occlusions of the device user. Hence, existing methods often fail to accurately estimate complex 3D poses from egocentric views. In this work, we propose a new transformer-based framework to improve egocentric stereo 3D human pose estimation, which leverages the scene information and temporal context of egocentric stereo videos. Specifically, we utilize 1) depth features from our 3D scene reconstruction module with uniformly sampled windows of egocentric stereo frames, and 2) human joint queries enhanced by temporal features of the video inputs. Our method is able to accurately estimate human poses even in challenging scenarios, such as crouching and sitting. Furthermore, we introduce two new benchmark datasets, i.e., UnrealEgo2 and UnrealEgo-RW (RealWorld). The proposed datasets offer a much larger number of egocentric stereo views with a wider variety of human motions than the existing datasets, allowing comprehensive evaluation of existing and upcoming methods.

{"title": "Human Gaussian Splatting: Real-Time Rendering of Animatable Avatars", "abstract": "This work addresses the problem of real-time rendering of photorealistic human body avatars learned from multi-view videos. While the classical approaches to model and render virtual humans generally use a textured mesh, recent research has developed neural body representations that achieve impressive visual quality. However, these models are difficult to render in real-time and their quality degrades when the character is animated with body poses different than the training observations. We propose an animatable human model based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, that has recently emerged as a very efficient alternative to neural radiance fields. The body is represented by a set of gaussian primitives in a canonical space which is deformed with a coarse to fine approach that combines forward skinning and local non-rigid refinement. We describe how to learn our Human Gaussian Splatting (HuGS) model in an end-to-end fashion from multi-view observations, and evaluate it against the state-of-the-art approaches for novel pose synthesis of clothed body.

The underlying challenge demands both a discriminating interpretation of language and a comprehen-sive physics-centric model supporting real-world dynamics. To ameliorate, this paper advocates HOIAnimator, a novel and interactive diffusion model with perception ability and also ingeniously crafted to revolutionize the animation of complex interactions from linguistic narratives. The effectiveness of our model is anchored in two ground-breaking innovations: (1) Our Perceptive Diffusion Models (PDM) brings together two types of models: one focused on hu-man movements and the other on objects. This combination allows for animations where humans and objects move in concert with each other, making the overall motion more realistic. Additionally, we propose a Perceptive Message Passing (PMP) mechanism to enhance the communication bridging the two models, ensuring that the animations are smooth and unified; (2) We devise an Interaction Contact Field (ICF), a sophisticated model that implicitly captures the essence of HOls. Beyond mere predictive contact points, the ICF assesses the proximity of human and object to their respective environment, informed by a probabilistic distribution of interactions learned throughout the denoising phase.

{"title": "Arbitrary Motion Style Transfer with Multi-Condition Motion Latent Diffusion Model", "abstract": "Computer animation's quest to bridge content and style has historically been a challenging venture, with previous efforts often leaning toward one at the expense of the other. This paper tackles the inherent challenge of content-style duality, ensuring a harmonious fusion where the core narrative of the content is both preserved and elevated through stylistic enhancements. We propose a novel Multi-condition Motion Latent Diffusion Model (MCM-LDM) for Arbitrary Motion Style Transfer (AMST). Our MCM-LDM significantly emphasizes preserving trajectories, recognizing their fundamental role in defining the essence and fluidity of motion content. Our MCM-LDM's cornerstone lies in its ability first to disentangle and then intricately weave together motion's tripartite components: motion trajectory, motion content, and motion style. The critical insight of MCM-LDM is to embed multiple conditions with distinct priorities. The content channel serves as the primary flow, guiding the overall structure and movement, while the trajectory and style channels act as auxiliary components and synchronize with the primary one dynamically. This mechanism ensures that multi-conditions can seamlessly integrate into the main flow, enhancing the overall animation without overshadowing the core content.

Upon receiving an open-vocabulary textual instruction, AnySkill employs a high-level policy that selects and integrates these atomic actions to maximize the CLIP similarity between the agent's rendered images and the text. An important feature of our method is the use of image-based rewards for the high-level policy, which allows the agent to learn interactions with objects without manual reward engineering.

Existing methods rely on a large amount of light-stage captured data to learn facial reflectance models. However, the lack of subject diversity poses challenges in achieving good generalization and widespread applicability. In this paper, we learn the reflectance prior in image space rather than UV space and present a framework named ID2Reflectance. Our framework can directly estimate the reflectance maps of a single image while using limited reflectance data for training. Our key insight is that reflectance data shares facial structures with RGB faces, which enables obtaining expressive facial prior from inexpensive RGB data thus re-ducing the dependency on reflectance data. We first learn a high-quality prior for facial reflectance. Specifically, we pretrain multi-domain facial feature code books and design a codebook fusion method to align the reflectance and RGB domains. Then, we propose an identity-conditioned swapping module that injects facial identity from the target image into the pre-trained autoencoder to modify the identity of the source reflectance image.

However, a naive application of Gaussian splatting cannot generate high-quality animatable avatars and suffers from learning instability; it also cannot capture fine avatar geometries and often leads to degenerate body parts. To tackle these problems, we first propose a primitive-based 3D Gaussian representation where Gaussians are defined inside pose-driven primitives to facilitate animation. Second, to stabilize and amortize the learning of millions of Gaussians, we propose to use neural implicit fields to predict the Gaussian attributes (e.g., colors). Finally, to capture fine avatar geometries and extract detailed meshes, we propose a novel SDF-based implicit mesh learning approach for 3D Gaussians that regularizes the underlying geometries and extracts highly detailed textured meshes.

{"title": "Relightable and Animatable Neural Avatar from Sparse-View Video", "abstract": "This paper tackles the problem of creating relightable and animatable neural avatars from sparse-view (or monocular) videos of dynamic humans under unknown illumination. Previous neural human reconstruction methods produce animatable avatars from sparse views using deformed Signed Distance Fields (SDF) but are non-relightable. While differentiable inverse rendering methods have succeeded in the material recovery of static objects, it is not straightforward to extend them to dynamic humans since it is computationally intensive to compute pixel-surface intersection and light visibility on deformed SDFs for relighting. To solve this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Distance Query (HDQ) algorithm to approximate the world space SDF under arbitrary human poses. Specifically, we estimate coarse SDF based on a parametric human model and compute fine SDF by exploiting the invariance of SDF w.r.t. local deformation. Based on HDQ, we leverage sphere tracing to efficiently estimate the surface intersection and light visibility. This allows us to develop the first system to recover relightable and animatable neural avatars from sparse or monocular inputs. Experiments show that our approach produces superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Given speech au-dio, we output multiple possibilities of gestural motion for an individual, including face, body, and hands. The key be-hind our method is in combining the benefits of sample di-versity from vector quantization with the high-frequency de-tails obtained through diffusion to generate more dynamic, expressive motion. We visualize the generated motion using highly photorealistic avatars that can express crucial nu-ances in gestures (e.g. sneers and smirks). To facilitate this line of research, we introduce a first-of-its-kind multi-view conversational dataset that allows for photorealistic reconstruction.

{"title": "Closely Interactive Human Reconstruction with Proxemics and Physics-Guided Adaption", "abstract": "Existing multi-person human reconstruction approaches mainly focus on recovering accurate poses or avoiding penetration, but overlook the modeling of close interactions. In this work, we tackle the task of reconstructing closely interactive humans from a monocular video. The main challenge of this task comes from insufficient visual information caused by depth ambiguity and severe inter-person occlusion. In view of this, we propose to leverage knowledge from proxemic behavior and physics to compensate the lack of visual information. This is based on the observation that human interaction has specific patterns following the social proxemics. Specifically, we first design a latent representation based on Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) to model human interaction. A proxemics and physics guided diffusion model is then introduced to denoise the initial distribution. We design the diffusion model as dual branch with each branch representing one individual such that the interaction can be modeled via cross attention. With the learned priors of VQ-VAE and physical constraint as the additional information, our proposed approach is capable of estimating accurate poses that are also proxemics and physics plausible. Experimental results on Hi4D, 3DPW, and CHI3D demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.

{"title": "Video-Based Human Pose Regression via Decoupled Space-Time Aggregation", "abstract": "By leveraging temporal dependency in video se-quences, multi-frame human pose estimation algorithms have demonstrated remarkable results in complicated sit-uations, such as occlusion, motion blur, and video defocus. These algorithms are predominantly based on heatmaps, re-sulting in high computation and storage requirements per frame, which limits their flexibility and real-time application in video scenarios, particularly on edge devices. In this paper, we develop an efficient and effective video-based hu-man pose regression method, which bypasses intermediate representations such as heatmaps and instead directly maps the input to the output joint coordinates. Despite the inher-ent spatial correlation among adjacent joints of the human pose, the temporal trajectory of each individual joint ex-hibits relative independence. In light of this, we propose a novel Decoupled Space-Time Aggregation network (DSTA) to separately capture the spatial contexts between adja-cent joints and the temporal cues of each individual joint, thereby avoiding the conflation of spatiotemporal dimensions. Concretely, DSTA learns a dedicated feature token for each joint to facilitate the modeling of their spatiotemporal dependencies. With the proposed joint-wise local-awareness attention mechanism, our method is capable of efficiently and flexibly utilizing the spatial dependency of adjacent joints and the temporal dependency of each joint itself. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared to previous regression-based single-frame human pose estimation methods, DSTA significantly enhances performance, achieving an 8.9 mAP improvement on PoseTrack2017. Furthermore, our approach either sur-passes or is on par with the state-of-the-art heatmap-based multi-frame human pose estimation methods.

{"title": "Rethinking Generalizable Face Anti-Spoofing via Hierarchical Prototype-Guided Distribution Refinement in Hyperbolic Space", "abstract": "Generalizable face anti-spoofing (FAS) approaches have drawn growing attention due to their robustness for diverse presentation attacks in unseen scenarios. Most previous methods always utilize domain generalization (DG) frame-works via directly aligning diverse source samples into a common feature space. However, these methods neglect the hierarchical relations in FAS samples which may hinder the generalization ability by direct alignment. To address these issues, we propose a novel Hierarchical Prototype-guided Distribution Refinement (HPDR)framework to learn embedding in hyperbolic space, which facilitates the hierarchical relation construction. We also collaborate with prototype learning for hierarchical distribution refinement in hyperbolic space. In detail, we propose the hierarchical Prototype Learning to simultaneously guide domain alignment and improve the discriminative ability via constraining the multi-level relations between prototypes and instances in hyperbolic space. Moreover, we design a Prototype-oriented Classifier, which further considers relations between the sample and prototypes to improve the robustness of the final decision.

{"title": "MoML: Online Meta Adaptation for 3D Human Motion Prediction", "abstract": "In the academic field, the research on human motion pre-diction tasks mainly focuses on exploiting the observed in-formation to forecast human movements accurately in the near future horizon. However, a significant gap appears when it comes to the application field, as current models are all trained offline, with fixed parameters that are inher-ently suboptimal to handle the complex yet ever-changing nature of human behaviors. To bridge this gap, in this pa-per, we introduce the task of online meta adaptation for hu-man motion prediction, based on the insight that finding “smart weights” capable of swift adjustments to suit dif-ferent motion contexts along the time is a key to improving predictive accuracy. We propose MoML, which ingeniously borrows the bilevel optimization spirit of model-agnostic meta-learning, to transform previous predictive mistakes into strong inductive biases to guide online adaptation. This is achieved by our MoAdapter blocks that can learn er-ror information by facilitating efficient adaptation via a few gradient steps, which fine-tunes our meta-learned “smart” initialization produced by the generic predictor. Considering real-time requirements in practice, we further propose Fast-MoML, a more efficient variant of MoML that features a closed-form solution instead of conventional gradient up-date.

{"title": "KITRO: Refining Human Mesh by 2D Clues and Kinematic-tree Rotation", "abstract": "2D keypoints are commonly used as an additional cue to refine estimated 3D human meshes. Current methods opti-mize the pose and shape parameters with a reprojection loss on the provided 2D keypoints. Such an approach, while sim-ple and intuitive, has limited effectiveness because the opti-mal solution is hard to find in ambiguous parameter space and may sacrifice depth. Additionally, divergent gradients from distal joints complicate and deviate the refinement of proximal joints in the kinematic chain. To address these, we introduce Kinematic-Tree Rotation (KITRO), a novel mesh refinement strategy that explicitly models depth and human kinematic-tree structure. KITRO treats refinement from a bone-wise perspective. Unlike previous methods which per-form gradient-based optimizations, our method calculates bone directions in closed form. By accounting for the 2D pose, bone length, and parent joint's depth, the calculation results in two possible directions for each child joint. We then use a decision tree to trace binary choices for all bones along the human skeleton's kinematic-tree to select the most probable hypothesis. Our experiments across var-ious datasets and baseline models demonstrate that KITRO significantly improves 3D joint estimation accuracy and achieves an ideal 2D fit simultaneously.

Given this conundrum, we introduce SD-Pose, a new self-distillation method for improving the performance of small transformer-based models. To mitigate the problem of under-fitting, we design a transformer module named Multi-Cycled Transformer(MCT) based on multiple-cycled forwards to more fully exploit the potential of small model parameters. Further, in order to prevent the additional inference compute-consuming brought by MCT, we introduce a self-distillation scheme, extracting the knowledge from the MCT module to a naive forward model.

{"title": "UltrAvatar: A Realistic Animatable 3D Avatar Diffusion Model with Authenticity Guided Textures", "abstract": "Recent advances in 3D avatar generation have gained significant attention. These breakthroughs aim to produce more realistic animatable avatars, narrowing the gap between virtual and real-world experiences. Most of existing works employ Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss, combined with a differentiable renderer and text condition, to guide a diffusion model in generating 3D avatars. How-ever, SDS often generates over-smoothed results with few facial details, thereby lacking the diversity compared with ancestral sampling. On the other hand, other works gen-erate 3D avatar from a single image, where the challenges of unwanted lighting effects, perspective views, and inferior image quality make them difficult to reliably reconstruct the 3D face meshes with the aligned complete textures. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D avatar generation approach termed UltrAvatar with enhanced fidelity of geometry, and superior quality of physically based rendering (PBR)textures without unwanted lighting. To this end, the proposed approach presents a diffuse color extraction model and an authenticity guided texture diffusion model. The former removes the unwanted lighting effects to reveal true diffuse colors, so that the generated avatars can be rendered under various lighting conditions. The latter follows two gradient-based guidances for generating PBR textures to render diverse face-identity features and details better aligning with 3D mesh geometry. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in the experiments.", "keywords": "Geometry, Image quality, Three-dimensional displays, Image color analysis, Avatars, Lighting, Diffusion models", "authors": "Mingyuan Zhou, Rakib Hyder, Ziwei Xuan, Guojun Qi"}

In this work, we design a model architecture that imitates Generative Pretraining Transformer (GPT), utilizing prior knowledge learned from human data to the animal domain. We jointly train motion autoencoders for both animal and human motions and at the same time optimize through the similarity scores among human motion encoding, animal motion encoding, and text CLIP embedding. Presenting the first solution to this problem, we are able to generate animal motions with high diversity and fidelity, quantitatively and qualitatively outperforming the results of training human motion generation baselines on animal data.

{"title": "TokenHMR: Advancing Human Mesh Recovery with a Tokenized Pose Representation", "abstract": "We address the problem of regressing 3D human pose and shape from a single image, with a focus on 3D accuracy. The current best methods leverage large datasets of 3D pseudo-ground-truth (p-GT) and 2D keypoints, leading to robust performance. With such methods, however, we observe a paradoxical decline in 3D pose accuracy with increasing 2D accuracy. This is caused by biases in the p-GT and the use of an approximate camera projection model. We quantify the error induced by current camera models and show that fitting 2D keypoints and p-GT accurately causes incorrect 3D poses. Our analysis defines the invalid distances within which minimizing 2D and p-GT losses is detrimental. We use this to formulate a new loss, “Threshold-Adaptive Loss Scaling” (TALS), that penalizes gross 2D and p-GT errors but not smaller ones. With such a loss, there are many 3D poses that could equally explain the 2D evidence. To reduce this ambiguity we need a prior over valid human poses but such priors can introduce unwanted bias. To address this, we exploit a tokenized representation of human pose and reformulate the problem as token prediction. This restricts the estimated poses to the space of valid poses, effectively improving robustness to occlusion. Exten-sive experiments on the EMDB and 3DPW datasets show that our reformulated loss and tokenization allows us to train on in-the-wild data while improving 3D accuracy over the state-of-the-art.

Instead of training a task-specific diffusion model for each new task, DNO operates by optimizing the diffusion latent noise of an existing pre-trained text-to-motion model. Given the corresponding latent noise of a human motion, it propagates the gradient from the target criteria defined on the motion space through the whole denoising process to update the diffusion latent noise. As a result, DNO supports any use cases where criteria can be defined as a function of motion. In particular, we show that, for motion editing and control, DNO outperforms existing meth-ods in both achieving the objective and preserving the motion content. DNO accommodates a diverse range of editing modes, including changing trajectory, pose, joint lo-cations, or avoiding newly added obstacles. In addition, DNO is effective in motion denoising and completion, pro-ducing smooth and realistic motion from noisy and partial inputs.

To address these challenges, we propose a fully automated approach for creating a fully rigged character with pose-dependent skinning weights, which can be solely learned from multi-view video.

These methods are often specialized, and the tasks they address are rarely extendable or customizable. We categorize these as solutions to the close-set motion control problem. In response to the complexity of practical motion control, we propose and attempt to solve the open-set motion control problem. This problem is characterized by an open and fully customizable set of motion control tasks. To address this, we introduce a new paradigm, programmable motion generation. In this paradigm, any given motion control task is broken down into a combination of atomic constraints. These constraints are then programmed into an error function that quantifies the degree to which a motion sequence adheres to them. We utilize a pretrained motion generation model and optimize its latent code to minimize the error function of the generated motion. Consequently, the generated motion not only inherits the prior of the generative model but also satisfies the requirements of the compounded constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate high-quality motions when addressing a wide range of unseen tasks. These tasks encompass motion control by motion dynamics, geometric constraints, physical laws, interactions with scenes, objects or the character's own body parts, etc. All of these are achieved in a unified approach, without the need for ad-hoc paired training data collection or specialized network designs. During the programming of novel tasks, we observed the emergence of new skills beyond those of the prior model. With the assistance of large language models, we also achieved automatic programming.

Existing an-imation works typically employ the frame-warping technique to animate the reference image towards the target motion. Despite achieving reasonable results, these approaches face challenges in maintaining temporal consistency throughout the animation due to the lack of temporal modeling and poor preservation of reference identity. In this work, we introduce Magic/snimate, a diffusion-based framework that aims at enhancing temporal consistency, preserving reference image faithfully, and improving animation fidelity. To achieve this, we first develop a video diffusion model to encode temporal information. Second, to maintain the appearance coherence across frames, we introduce a novel appearance encoder to retain the intricate details of the reference image. Leveraging these two inno-vations, we further employ a simple video fusion technique to encourage smooth transitions for long video animation. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of our method over baseline approaches on two benchmarks. Notably, our approach outperforms the strongest baseline by over 38% in terms of video fidelity on the challenging TikTok dancing dataset.

On the other hand, collecting domain-specific ground truth such as 2D or 3D labels does not scale well. Therefore, we propose a pre-training approach based on self-supervised learning that works on human-centric data using only images. Our method uses pairs of images of humans: the first is partially masked and the model is trained to reconstruct the masked parts given the visible ones and a second image. It relies on both stereoscopic (cross-view) pairs, and tempo-ral (cross-pose) pairs taken from videos, in order to learn priors about 3D as well as human motion. We pre-train a model for body-centric tasks and one for hand-centric tasks.

The outputs can then be combined with other assets to create novel clothed human avatars with any pose. Existing reconstruction approaches often treat clothed humans as a single-layer of geometry and overlook the inherent compositionality of humans with hairstyles, clothing, and accessories, thereby limiting the utility of the meshes for down-stream applications. Decomposing a single-layer mesh into separate layers is a challenging task because it requires the synthesis of plausible geometry and texture for the severely occluded regions. Moreover, even with successful decomposition, meshes are not normalized in terms of poses and body shapes, failing coherent composition with novel identities and poses. To address these challenges, we propose to leverage the general knowledge of a pretrained 2D diffusion model as geometry and appearance prior for humans and other assets. We first separate the input mesh using the 3D surface segmentation extracted from multi-view 2D segmentations. Then we synthesize the missing geometry of different layers in both posed and canonical spaces using a novel pose-guided Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss. Once we complete inpainting high-fidelity 3D geometry, we also apply the same SDS loss to its texture to obtain the complete appearance including the initially occluded regions. Through a series of decomposition steps, we obtain multiple layers of 3D assets in a shared canonical space normalized in terms of poses and human shapes, hence supporting effortless composition to novel identities and reanimation with novel poses.

{"title": "MMM: Generative Masked Motion Model", "abstract": "Recent advances in text-to-motion generation using dif-fusion and autoregressive models have shown promising re-sults. However, these models often suffer from a trade-off between real-time performance, high fidelity, and motion editability. To address this gap, we introduce MMM, a novel yet simple motion generation paradigm based on Masked Motion Model. MMM consists of two key components: (1) a motion tokenizer that transforms 3D human motion into a sequence of discrete tokens in latent space, and (2) a conditional masked motion transformer that learns to predict randomly masked motion tokens, conditioned on the pre-computed text tokens. By attending to motion and text to-kens in all directions, MMM explicitly captures inherent dependency among motion tokens and semantic mapping between motion and text tokens. During inference, this al-lows parallel and iterative decoding of multiple motion to-kens that are highly consistent with fine-grained text de-scriptions, therefore simultaneously achieving high-fidelity and high-speed motion generation. In addition, MMM has innate motion editability. By simply placing mask tokens in the place that needs editing, MMM automatically fills the gaps while guaranteeing smooth transitions between editing and non-editing parts. Extensive experiments on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets demonstrate that MMM surpasses current leading methods in generating high-quality motion (evidenced by superior FID scores of 0.08 and 0.429), while offering advanced editing features such as body-part modification, motion in-betweening, and the synthesis of long motion sequences.

Comprehensive Vision Solution for In-Vehicle Gaze Estimation", "abstract": "Driver's eye gaze holds a wealth of cognitive and intentional cues crucial for intelligent vehicles. Despite its sig-nificance, research on in-vehicle gaze estimation remains limited due to the scarcity of comprehensive and well-annotated datasets in real driving scenarios. In this pa-per, we present three novel elements to advance in-vehicle gaze research. Firstly, we introduce IVGaze, a pioneering dataset capturing in-vehicle gaze, collected from 125 sub-jects and covering a large range of gaze and head poses within vehicles. In this dataset, we propose a new vision-based solution for in-vehicle gaze collection, introducing a refined gaze target calibration method to tackle annotation challenges. Second, our research focuses on in-vehicle gaze estimation leveraging the IvGaze. In-vehicle face images often suffer from low resolution, prompting our in-troduction of a gaze pyramid transformer that leverages transformer-based multilevel features integration. Expanding upon this, we introduce the dual-stream gaze pyramid transformer (GazeDPTR). Employing perspective transfor-mation, we rotate virtual cameras to normalize images, uti-lizing camera pose to merge normalized and original images for accurate gaze estimation. GazeDPTR shows state-of-the-art performance on the IVGaze dataset. Thirdly, we explore a novel strategy for gaze zone classification by extending the GazeDPTR. A foundational tri-plane and project gaze onto these planes are newly defined.

Variability allows the avatar to exhibit a wide range of motions even with similar speech content, while coordination ensures a harmonious alignment among facial expressions, hand gestures, and body poses. We aim to achieve both with ProbTalk, a unified probabilistic framework designed to jointly model facial, hand, and body movements in speech. ProbTalk builds on the variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture and incorporates three core designs. First, we introduce product quantization (PQ) to the VAE, which enriches the representation of complex holistic motion. Second, we devise a novel non-autoregressive model that embeds 2D positional encoding into the product-quantized representation, thereby preserving essential structure information of the PQ codes. Last, we employ a secondary stage to refine the preliminary prediction, further sharpening the high-frequency details. Coupling these three designs enables ProbTalk to generate natural and diverse holistic co-speech motions, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, particularly in terms of realism.

{"title": "Text2HOI: Text-Guided 3D Motion Generation for Hand-Object Interaction", "abstract": "This paper introduces the first text-guided work for generating the sequence of hand-object interaction in 3D. The main challenge arises from the lack of labeled data where existing ground-truth datasets are nowhere near generalizable in interaction type and object category, which inhibits the modeling of diverse 3D hand-object interaction with the correct physical implication (e.g., contacts and semantics) from text prompts. To address this challenge, we propose to decompose the interaction generation task into two subtasks: hand-object contact generation; and hand-object motion generation. For contact generation, a VAE-based network takes as input a text and an object mesh, and generates the probability of contacts between the surfaces of hands and the object during the interaction. The network learns a variety of local geometry structure of diverse objects that is independent of the objects' category, and thus, it is applicable to general objects. For motion generation, a Transformer-based diffusion model utilizes this 3D contact map as a strong prior for generating physically plausible hand-object motion as a function of text prompts by learning from the augmented labeled dataset; where we annotate text labels from many existing 3D hand and object motion data. Finally, we further introduce a hand refiner module that minimizes the distance between the object surface and hand joints to improve the temporal stability of the object-hand contacts and to suppress the penetration artifacts. In the experiments, we demonstrate that our method can generate more realistic and diverse interactions compared to other baseline methods. We also show that our method is applicable to unseen objects. We will release our model and newly labeled data as a strong foundation for future research.

Despite their impressive performance on public benchmarks, existing methods are vulnerable to unusual poses, which prevents them from deploying to challenging scenarios such as dance and martial arts. This issue is mainly attributed to the domain gap induced by the data scarcity in relevant cases. Most existing datasets are captured in constrained scenarios and lack samples of such complex movements. For this reason, we propose a data collection pipeline comprising automatic crawling, precise annotation, and hardcase mining. Based on this pipeline, we establish a large dataset in a short time. The dataset, named HardMo, contains 7M images along with precise annotations covering 15 categories of dance and 14 categories of martial arts. Empirically, we find that the prediction failure in dance and martial arts is mainly characterized by the misalignment of hand-wrist and foot-ankle.

This paper seeks a solution by putting forward the Confidence-Calibrated Face Image Quality Assessment (CLIB-FIQA) approach, underpinned by the synergistic interplay between the quality anchors and objective quality factors such as blur, pose, expression, occlusion, and illumination. Specifically, we devise a joint learning framework built upon the vision-language alignment model, which leverages the joint distribution with multiple quality factors to facilitate the quality fitting of the FIQA model. Furthermore, to alleviate the issue of the model placing excessive trust in inaccurate quality anchors, we propose a confidence calibration method to correct the quality distribution by exploiting to the fullest extent of these objective quality factors characterized as the merged-factor distribution during training.

This work fills this gap and introduces a novel paradigm: forecasting 3D whole-body human poses with a focus on grasping objects. This task involves predicting activities across all joints in the body and hands, encompassing the complexities of internal heterogeneity and external interactivity. To tackle these challenges, we also propose a novel approach: C\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\nHOST, cross-context cross-modal consolidation for 3D whole-body pose forecasting, effectively handles the complexities of internal heterogeneity and external interactivity.

TRUMANS stands as the most comprehensive motion-captured HSI dataset currently available, encompassing over 15 hours of human interactions across 100 indoor scenes. It intricately captures whole-body human motions and part-level object dynamics, focusing on the realism of contact. This dataset is further scaled up by transforming physical environments into exact virtual models and applying extensive augmentations to appearance and motion for both humans and objects while maintaining interaction fidelity. Utilizing TRUMANS, we devise a diffusion-based autoregressive model that efficiently generates Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) sequences of any length, taking into account both scene context and intended actions.

Moreover, training solely with this type of data leads to poor generalization with in-the-wild images.

{"title": "FaceLift: Semi-Supervised 3D Facial Landmark Localization", "abstract": "3D facial landmark localization has proven to be of particular use for applications, such as face tracking, 3D face modeling, and image-based 3D face reconstruction. In the supervised learning case, such methods usually rely on 3D landmark datasets derived from 3DMM-based registration that often lack spatial definition alignment, as compared with that chosen by hand-labeled human consensus, e.g., how are eyebrow landmarks defined? This creates a gap between landmark datasets generated via high-quality 2D human labels and 3DMMs, and it ultimately limits their effectiveness. To address this issue, we introduce a novel semi-supervised learning approach that learns 3D landmarks by directly lifting (visible) hand-labeled 2D landmarks and ensures better definition alignment, without the need for 3D landmark datasets. To lift 2D landmarks to 3D, we leverage 3D-aware GANs for better multi-view consistency learning and in-the-wild multi-frame videos for robust cross-generalization. Empirical experiments demonstrate that our method not only achieves better definition alignment between 2D-3D landmarks but also outperforms other supervised learning 3D landmark localization methods on both 3DMM labeled and photogrammetric ground truth evaluation datasets.

{"title": "Fast Adaptation for Human Pose Estimation via Meta-Optimization", "abstract": "Domain shift is a challenge for supervised human pose estimation, where the source data and target data come from different distributions. This is why pose estimation methods generally perform worse on the test set than on the training set. Recently, test-time adaptation has proven to be an effective way to deal with domain shift in human pose estimation. Although the performance on the target domain has been improved, existing methods require a large number of weight updates for convergence, which is time-consuming and brings catastrophic forgetting. To solve these issues, we propose a meta-auxiliary learning method to achieve fast adaptation for domain shift during inference. Specifically, we take human pose estimation as the supervised primary task, and propose body-specific image inpainting as a self-supervised auxiliary task. First, we Jointly train the primary and auxiliary tasks to get a pre-trained model on the source domain. Then, meta-training correlates the performance of the two tasks to learn a good weight initialization. Finally, meta-testing adapts the meta-learned model to the target data through self-supervised learning. Benefiting from the meta-learning paradigm, the proposed method enables fast adaptation to the target domain while preserving the source domain knowledge. The carefully designed auxiliary task better pays attention to human-related semantics in a single image.

{"title": "SynSP: Synergy of Smoothness and Precision in Pose Sequences Refinement", "abstract": "Predicting human pose sequences via existing pose estimators often encounters various estimation errors. Motion refinement methods aim to optimize the predicted human pose sequences from pose estimators while ensuring minimal computational overhead and latency. Prior investigations have primarily concentrated on striking a balance between the two objectives, i.e., smoothness and precision, while optimizing the predicted pose sequences. However, it has come to our attention that the tension between these two objectives can provide additional quality cues about the predicted pose sequences. These cues, in turn, are able to aid the network in optimizing lower-quality poses. To leverage this quality information, we propose a motion refinement network, termed SynSP, to achieve a Synergy of Smoothness and Precision in the sequence refinement tasks. Moreover, SynSP can also address multi-view poses of one person simultaneously, fixing inaccuracies in predicted poses through heightened attention to similar poses from other views, thereby amplifying the resultant quality cues and overall performance. Compared with previous methods, SynSP benefits from both pose quality and multi-view information with a much shorter input sequence length, achieving state-of-the-art results among four challenging datasets involving 2D, 3D, and SMPL pose representations in both single-view and multi-view scenes.

Most existing methods have tack-led this task in a two-stage manner, first detecting the human body part with an off-the-shelf detection model and then in-ferring the different human body parts individually. Despite the impressive results achieved, these methods suffer from 1) loss of valuable contextual information via cropping, 2) introducing distractions, and 3) lacking inter-association among different persons and body parts, inevitably causing performance degradation, especially for crowded scenes. To address these issues, we introduce a novel ali-in-one-stage framework, AiOS, for multiple expressive human pose and shape recovery without an additional human detection step.

This is consequently followed by two distinct bidirectional transformers. For the base-layer motion tokens, a Masked Transformer is designated to predict randomly masked motion tokens conditioned on text input at training stage. During generation (i. e. inference) stage, starting from an empty sequence, our Masked Transformer iteratively fills up the missing tokens; Subsequently, a Residual Transformer learns to progressively predict the next-layer tokens based on the results from current layer.

Instead, these methods directly output animations from speech without control over the expressed emotion. To address this limitation, we present AMUSE, an emotional speech-driven body animation model based on latent diffusion. Our observation is that content (i.e., gestures related to speech rhythm and word utterances), emotion, and personal style are separable. To account for this, AMUSE maps the driving audio to three disentangled latent vectors: one for content, one for emotion, and one for personal style. A latent diffusion model, trained to generate gesture motion sequences, is then conditioned on these latent vectors. Once trained, AMUSE synthesizes 3D human gestures directly from speech with control over the expressed emotions and style by combining the content from the driving speech with the emotion and style of another speech sequence. Randomly sampling the noise of the diffusion model further generates variations of the gesture with the same emotional expressivity. Qualitative, quantitative, and perceptual evaluations demonstrate that AMUSE outputs realistic gesture sequences. Compared to the state of the art, the generated gestures are better synchronized with the speech content, and better represent the emotion expressed by the input speech.

While attempts have been made to develop fast neural rendering approaches for static scenes, these methods cannot be simply employed to support realistic facial expressions, such as in the case of a dynamic facial performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel fast 3D neural implicit head avatar model that achieves real-time rendering while maintaining fine-grained controllability and high rendering quality. Our key idea lies in the introduction of local hash table blendshapes, which are learned and attached to the vertices of an underlying face parametric model. These per-vertex hash-tables are linearly merged with weights predicted via a CNN, re-sulting in expression dependent embeddings. Our novel representation enables efficient density and color predictions using a lightweight MLP, which is further accelerated by a hierarchical nearest neighbor search method. Extensive experiments show that our approach runs in real-time while achieving comparable rendering quality to state-of-the-arts and decent results on challenging expressions.", "keywords": "Teleconferencing, Solid modeling, Three-dimensional displays, Avatars, Face recognition, Nearest neighbor methods, Rendering (computer graphics)", "authors": "Ziqian Bai, Feitong Tan, Sean Fanello, Rohit Pandey, Mingsong Dou, Shichen Liu, Ping Tan, Yinda Zhang"}

Deep learning methods for SL recognition and translation have achieved promising results.

In this work, a diffusion-based SLP model is trained on a curated large-scale dataset of 4D signing avatars and their corresponding text transcripts. The proposed method can generate dynamic sequences of 3D avatars from an un-constrained domain of discourse using a diffusion process formed on a novel and anatomically informed graph neu-ral network defined on the SMPL-X body skeleton. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we show that the proposed method considerably outperforms previous meth-ods of SLP.

{"title": "Sharingan: A Transformer Architecture for Multi-Person Gaze Following", "abstract": "Gaze is a powerful form of non-verbal communication that humans develop from an early age. As such, modeling this behavior is an important task that can benefit a broad set of application domains ranging from robotics to sociology. In particular, the gaze following task in computer vision is defined as the prediction of the 2D pixel coordinates where a person in the image is looking. Previous attempts in this area have primarily centered on CNN-based architectures, but they have been constrained by the need to process one person at a time, which proves to be highly inefficient. In this paper, we introduce a novel and effective multi-person transformer-based architecture for gaze prediction. While there exist prior works using transformers for multi-person gaze prediction [38], [39], they use a fixed set of learnable embeddings to decode both the person and its gaze target, which requires a matching step afterward to link the predictions with the annotations. Thus, it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate these methods reliably with the available benchmarks, or integrate them into a larger human behavior understanding system. Instead, we are the first to propose a multi-person transformer-based architecture that maintains the original task formulation and ensures control over the people fed as input. Our main contribution lies in encoding the person-specific information into a single controlled token to be processed alongside image tokens and using its output for prediction based on a novel multiscale decoding mechanism. Our new architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the GazeFollow, VideoAttentionTarget, and ChildPlay datasets and outperforms comparable multi-person architectures with a notable margin.

{"title": "Degrees of Freedom Matter: Inferring Dynamics from Point Trajectories", "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of generic 3D scenes is fundamentally challenging in computer vision, essential in enhancing applications related to scene reconstruction, motion tracking, and avatar creation. In this work, we address the task as the problem of inferring dense, long-range motion of 3D points. By observing a set of point trajectories, we aim to learn an implicit motion field parameterized by a neural network to predict the movement of novel points within the same domain, without relying on any data-driven or scene-specific priors. To achieve this, our approach builds upon the recently introduced dynamic point field model [48] that learns smooth deformation fields between the canonical frame and individual observation frames. However, temporal consistency between consecutive frames is neglected, and the number of required parameters increases linearly with the sequence length due to per-frame modeling. To address these shortcomings, we exploit the intrinsic regularization provided by SIREN [53], and modify the input layer to produce a spatiotemporally smooth motion field. Additionally, we analyze the motion field Jacobian matrix, and discover that the motion degrees of freedom (DOFs) in an infinitesimal area around a point and the network hidden variables have different behaviors to affect the model's representational power. This enables us to improve the model representation capability while retaining the model compactness. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of overfitting, we introduce a regularization term based on the assumption of piece-wise motion smoothness. Our experiments assess the model's performance in predicting unseen point trajectories and its application in temporal mesh alignment with guidance.

The conventional separate pipeline suffers from the accumulated errors from the tracking stage, which cannot be recovered in the modeling stage. On the other hand, ours does not suffer from the accumulated errors while having a much more concise overall pipeline.

However, an inherent flaw has come to light in these cutting-edge models: they tend to optimize the adjacency matrix jointly with the model weights. This process, while seemingly efficient, causes a gradual decay of bone connectiv-ity data, resulting in a model indifferent to the very topology it sought to represent. To remedy this, we propose a two-fold strategy: (1) We introduce an innovative approach that encodes bone connectivity by harnessing the power of graph distances to describe the physical topology; we further incorporate action-specific topological representation via persistent homology analysis to depict systemic dynamics. This preserves the vital topological nuances often lost in conventional GCNs. (2) Our investigation also reveals the redundancy in existing GCNs for multi-relational modeling, which we address by proposing an efficient refinement to Graph Convolutions (GC) - the BlockGC. This signif-icantly reduces parameters while improving performance beyond original GCNs.

{"title": "Self-Supervised Facial Representation Learning with Facial Region Awareness", "abstract": "Self-supervised pretraining has been proved to be effective in learning transferable representations that benefit various visual tasks. This paper asks this question: can self-supervised pretraining learn general facial representations for various facial analysis tasks? Recent efforts to-ward this goal are limited to treating each face image as a whole, i.e., learning consistent facial representations at the image-level, which overlooks the “consistency of local facial representations“(i.e., facial regions like eyes, nose, etc). In this work, we make a first attempt to propose a novel self-supervised facial representation learning framework to learn consistent global and local facial representations, Facial Region Awareness (FRA). Specifically, we explicitly enforce the consistency of facial regions by matching the local facial representations across views, which are extracted with learned heatmaps highlighting the facial regions. Inspired by the mask prediction in supervised semantic segmentation, we obtain the heatmaps via cosine simi-larity between the per-pixel projection of feature maps and “facial mask embeddings” computed from learnable positional embeddings, which leverage the attention mechanism to globally look up the facial image for facial regions. To learn such heatmaps, we formulate the learning of facial mask embeddings as a deep clustering problem by assigning the pixel features from the feature maps to them. The transfer learning results on facial classification and regression tasks show that our FRA outperforms previous pretrained models and more importantly, using ResNet as the unified backbone for various tasks, our FRA achieves comparable or even better performance compared with SOTA methods in facial analysis tasks.", "keywords": "Heating systems, Representation learning, Visualization, Attention mechanisms, Semantic segmentation, Transfer learning, Nose", "authors": "Zheng Gao, Ioannis Patras"}

Traditional human pose estimation and generation methods often op-erate in isolation, lacking semantic understanding and rea-soning abilities. ChatPose addresses these limitations by embedding SMPL poses as distinct signal tokens within a multimodal LLM, enabling the direct generation of 3D body poses from both textual and visual inputs. Leveraging the powerful capabilities of multimodal LLMs, ChatPose uni-fies classical 3D human pose and generation tasks while offering user interactions. Additionally, ChatPose empow-ers LLMs to apply their extensive world knowledge in rea-soning about human poses, leading to two advanced tasks: speculative pose generation and reasoning about pose esti-mation.

In addressing this constraint and fully leveraging manual annotations of AU intensities for precise manipulation, we introduce AUEditNet.

{"title": "PoseIRM: Enhance 3D Human Pose Estimation on Unseen Camera Settings via Invariant Risk Minimization", "abstract": "Camera-parameter-free multi-view pose estimation is an emerging technique for 3D human pose estimation (HPE). They can infer the camera settings implicitly or explicitly to mitigate the depth uncertainty impact, showcasing significant potential in real applications. However, due to the limited camera setting diversity in the available datasets, the inferred camera parameters are always simply hard-coded into the model during training and not adaptable to the input in inference, making the learned models cannot generalize well under unseen camera settings. A natural solution is to artificially synthesize some samples, i.e., 2D-3D pose pairs, under massive new camera settings. Un-fortunately, to prevent over-fitting the existing camera setting, the number of synthesized samples for each new camera setting should be comparable with that for the existing one, which multiplies the scale of training and even makes it computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a novel HPE approach under the invariant risk minimization (IRM) paradigm. Precisely, we first synthesize 2D poses from myriad camera settings. We then train our model under the IRM paradigm, which targets at learning a common optimal model across all camera settings and thus enforces the model to automatically learn the camera parameters based on the input data. This allows the model to accurately infer 3D poses on unseen data by training on only a hand-ful of samples from each synthesized setting and thus avoid the unbearable training cost increment. Another appealing feature of our method is that benefited from the capability of IRM in identifying the invariant features, its performance on the seen camera settings is enhanced as well.

However, the newly synthe-sized faces either closely resemble the reference image in terms of facial attributes, such as expression, or exhibit a reduced capacity for identity preservation. Text descriptions intended to guide the facial attributes of the synthesized face may fall short, owing to the intricate entanglement of identity information with identity-irrelevant facial attributes derived from the reference image.

Specifically, we address the challenge of scarce loose-wear IMU training data by proposing a Secondary Motion AutoEncoder (SeMo-AE) that learns to model and synthesize the effects of secondary motion between the skin and loose clothing on IMU data. SeMo-AE is leveraged to generate a diverse synthetic dataset of loose-wear IMU data to augment training for the pose estimation network and significantly improve its accuracy. For validation, we collected a dataset with various subjects and 2 wearing styles (zipped and unzipped). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach maintains high-quality real-time posture estimation even in loose-wear scenarios.

Despite their practical success, these anatomical models are slow to evaluate and often require extensive data capture to be built. We propose the anatomical implicit face model; an ensem-ble of implicit neural networks that jointly learn to model the facial anatomy and the skin surface with high-fidelity, and can readily be used as a drop in replacement to con-ventional blendshape models. Given an arbitrary set of skin surface meshes of an actor and only a neutral shape with estimated skull and jaw bones, our method can recover a dense anatomical substructure which constrains every point on the facial surface.

Existing one-stage deterministic re-gression methods, though efficient, are often prone to missed or false detections in crowded or occluded scenes, due to their inability to reason pose ambiguity. To address these challenges, we handle ambiguous poses in a generative fashion, i.e., sampling from the image-conditioned pose distributions characterized by a diffusion probabilistic model. Specifically, with initial pose tokens extracted from the image, noisy pose candidates are progressively refined by inter-acting with the initial tokens via attention layers. Extensive evaluations on the COCO and CrowdPose datasets show that DiffusionRegPose clearly improves the pose accuracy in crowded scenarios, as evidenced by a notable 4. 0 AP in-crease in the AP\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">H</inf>\n metric on the CrowdPose dataset.

{"title": "A Dual-Augmentor Framework for Domain Generalization in 3D Human Pose Estimation", "abstract": "3D human pose data collected in controlled laboratory settings present challenges for pose estimators that generalize across diverse scenarios. To address this, domain generalization is employed. Current methodologies in do-main generalization for 3D human pose estimation typically utilize adversarial training to generate synthetic poses for training. Nonetheless, these approaches exhibit several limitations. First, the lack of prior information about the target domain complicates the application of suitable augmentation through a single pose augmentor, affecting generalization on target domains. Moreover, adversarial training's discriminator tends to enforce similarity between source and synthesized poses, impeding the exploration of out-of-source distributions. Furthermore, the pose estimator's op-timization is not exposed to domain shifts, limiting its over-all generalization ability. To address these limitations, we propose a novel frame-work featuring two pose augmentors: the weak and the strong augmentors. Our framework employs differential strategies for generation and discrimination processes, facilitating the preservation of knowledge related to source poses and the exploration of out-of-source distributions without prior information about target poses. Besides, we leverage meta-optimization to simulate domain shifts in the optimization process of the pose estimator, thereby improving its generalization ability.

There are two main challenges: 1) A suitable motion feature is needed to describe complex human movements with crucial appearance information. 2) Gestures and speech exhibit inherent dependencies and should be temporally aligned even of arbitrary length. To solve these problems, we present a novel motion-decoupled framework to gener-ate co-speech gesture videos.

Essentially, the 3D hand pose estimation can be regarded as a 3D point subset generative problem conditioned on input frames. Thanks to the recent significant progress on diffusion-based generative models, hand pose estimation can also benefit from the diffusion model to estimate keypoint locations with high quality. However, directly deploying the existing diffusion models to solve hand pose estimation is non-trivial, since they cannot achieve the complex permutation mapping and precise localization. Based on this motivation, this paper proposes HandDiff, a diffusion-based hand pose estimation model that iteratively denoises accurate hand pose conditioned on hand-shaped image-point clouds.

{"title": "Towards Robust 3D Pose Transfer with Adversarial Learning", "abstract": "3D pose transfer that aims to transfer the desired pose to a target mesh is one of the most challenging 3D generation tasks. Previous attempts rely on well-defined parametric human models or skeletal joints as driving pose sources. However, to obtain those clean pose sources, cumbersome but necessary pre-processing pipelines are inevitable, hindering implementations of the real-time applications. This work is driven by the intuition that the robustness of the model can be enhanced by introducing adversarial samples into the training, leading to a more invulnerable model to the noisy inputs, which even can be further extended to directly handling the real-world data like raw point clouds/scans without intermediate processing. Furthermore, we propose a novel 3D pose Masked Autoencoder (3D-PoseMAE), a customized MAE that effectively learns 3D extrinsic presentations (i.e., pose). 3D-PoseMAE facilitates learning from the aspect of extrinsic attributes by simultaneously generating adversarial samples that perturb the model and learning the arbitrary raw noisy poses via a multi-scale masking strategy. Both qualitative and quantitative studies show that the transferred meshes given by our network result in much better quality. Besides, we demonstrate the strong generalizability of our method on various poses, different domains, and even raw scans.

Our key observation is that there exist medium-sized 3D scan datasets like CAPE, as well as large-scale 2D image datasets of clothed humans and multiple appearances can be mapped to a single geometry. To effectively learn from the two data modalities, we propose an unpaired learning procedure for pose-dependent clothed and textured human meshes.

Next, we train a geometry conditioned texture generator in an unsupervised way using the 2D image data. We use intermediate activations of the learned geometry model to condition our texture generator.

However, achieving generalizable face land-marking is challenging due to the diversity of facial styles and the scarcity of labeled stylized faces. In this study, we propose a simple but effective paradigm to learn a generalizable face landmarker based on labeled real human faces and unlabeled stylized faces. Our method learns the face landmarker as the key module of a conditional face warper. Given a pair of real and stylized facial images, the conditional face warper predicts a warping field from the real face to the stylized one, in which the face landmarker predicts the ending points of the warping field and provides us with high-quality pseudo landmarks for the corresponding stylized facial images. Applying an alternating optimization strategy, we learn the face landmarker to minimize i) the discrepancy between the stylized faces and the warped real ones and ii) the prediction errors of both real and pseudo landmarks.

HanDiffuser consists of two components: a Text-to-Hand-Params diffusion model to generate SMPL-Body and MANO-Hand parameters from input text prompts, and a Text-Guided Hand-Params-to-Image diffusion model to synthesize images by conditioning on the prompts and hand parameters generated by the previous component. We incorporate multiple aspects of hand representation, including 3D shapes and joint-level finger positions, orientations and articulations, for robust learning and reliable performance during inference. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments and perform user studies to demonstrate the efficacy of our method in generating images with high-quality hands.

Current methods focus on singular facets of the problem-predicting only 2D/3D poses, generating 2D pressure images, predicting pressure only for certain body regions instead of the full body, or forming indirect approximations to the 3D pressure map. In contrast, we introduce BodyMAP, which jointly predicts the human body mesh and 3D applied pressure map across the entire human body. Our network leverages multiple visual modalities, incorporating both a depth image of a person in bed and its corresponding 2D pressure image acquired from a pressure-sensing mattress. The 3D pressure map is represented as a pressure value at each mesh vertex and thus allows for precise localization of high-pressure regions on the body. Additionally, we present BodyMAP-Ws, a new formulation of pressure prediction in which we implicitly learn pressure in 3D by aligning sensed 2D pressure images with a differentiable 2D projection of the predicted 3D pressure maps. In evaluations with real-world human data, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art technique by 25% on both body mesh and 3D applied pressure map prediction tasks for people in bed.", "keywords": "Location awareness, Visualization, Three-dimensional displays, Shape, Prevention and mitigation, Data visualization, Medical services", "authors": "Abhishek Tandon, Anujraaj Goyal, Henry M.

{"title": "3D Facial Expressions through Analysis-by-Neural-Synthesis", "abstract": "While existing methods for 3D face reconstruction from in-the-wild images excel at recovering the overall face shape, they commonly miss subtle, extreme, asymmetric, or rarely observed expressions. We improve upon these meth-ods with SMIRK (Spatial Modeling for Image-based Reconstruction of Kinesics), which faithfully reconstructs expres-sive 3D faces from images. We identify two key limitations in existing methods: shortcomings in their self-supervised training formulation, and a lack of expression diversity in the training images. For training, most methods employ differentiable rendering to compare a predicted face mesh with the input image, along with a plethora of additional loss functions. This differentiable rendering loss not only has to provide supervision to optimize for 3D face geom-etry, camera, albedo, and lighting, which is an ill-posed optimization problem, but the domain gap between ren-dering and input image further hinders the learning pro-cess. Instead, SMIRK replaces the differentiable rendering with a neural rendering module that, given the ren-dered predicted mesh geometry, and sparsely sampled pix-els of the input image, generates a face image. As the neural rendering gets color information from sampled im-age pixels, supervising with neural rendering-based reconstruction loss can focus solely on the geometry. Further it enables us to generate images of the input identity with varying expressions while training. These are then utilized as input to the reconstruction model and used as supervision with ground truth geometry. This effectively augments the training data and enhances the generalization for di-verse expressions. Our qualitative, quantitative and partic-ularly our perceptual evaluations demonstrate that SMIRK achieves the new state-of-the art performance on accurate expression reconstruction.

We propose two self-supervised learning objectives: self-supervised person localization in 3d space and self-supervised 3d pose estimation. We achieve self-supervised 3d person localization by training the model on synthetically generated 3d points, serving as 3d person root positions, and on the projected root-heatmaps in all the views. We then model the 3d poses of all the localized persons with a bottleneck representation, map them onto all views obtaining 2d joints, and render them using 2d Gaussian heatmaps in an end-to-end differentiable manner. Afterwards, we use the corresponding 2d joints and heatmaps from the pseudo 2d poses for learning. To alleviate the intrinsic inaccuracy of the pseudo labels, we propose an adaptive supervision attention mechanism to guide the self-supervision.

When adopting diffusion models for image restoration, the crucial challenge lies in how to preserve high-level image fidelity in the random-ness diffusion process and generate accurate background structures and realistic texture details. In this paper, we propose a general framework and develop a Diffusion Texture Prior Model (DTPM) for image restoration tasks. DTPM explicitly models high-quality texture details through the diffusion process, rather than global contextual content. In phase one of the training stage, we pretrain DTPM on approximately 55K high-quality image samples, after which we freeze most of its parameters. In phase two, we insert conditional guidance adapters into DTPM and equip it with an initial predictor, thereby facilitating its rapid adaptation to downstream image restoration tasks. Our DTPM could mitigate the randomness of traditional diffusion models by utilizing encapsulated rich and diverse texture knowledge and background structural information provided by the initial predictor during the sampling process.", "keywords": "Training, Computer vision, Adaptation models, Image synthesis, Computational modeling, Diffusion processes, Diffusion models", "authors": "Tian Ye, Sixiang Chen, Wenhao Chai, Zhaohu Xing, Jing Qin, Ge Lin, Lei Zhu"}

Our study introduces Upscale-A-Video, a text-guided latent diffusion framework for video upscaling. This framework ensures temporal coherence through two key mechanisms: locally, it integrates temporal layers into U-Net and VAE-Decoder, maintaining consistency within short sequences; globally, without training, a flow-guided recurrent latent propagation module is introduced to enhance overall video stability by propagating and fusing latent across the entire sequences. Thanks to the diffusion paradigm, our model also offers greater flexibility by allowing text prompts to guide texture creation and adjustable noise levels to balance restoration and generation, enabling a trade-off between fidelity and quality.

The role of alignment is well-studied for low-level enhancement in video, but existing works overlook a critical step - resampling. We show through extensive experiments that for alignment to be effective, the resam-pIing should preserve the reference frequency spectrum while minimizing spatial distortions. However, most ex-isting works simply use a default choice of bilinear inter-polation for resampling even though bilinear interpolation has a smoothing effect and hinders super-resolution. From these observations, we propose an implicit resampling-based alignment. The sampling positions are encoded by a sinusoidal positional encoding, while the value is es-timated with a coordinate network and a window-based cross-attention. We show that bilinear interpolation inher-ently attenuates high-frequency information while an MLP-based coordinate network can approximate more frequen-cies.

Our method is based on the observation that the space of a generative model needs to be constrained. We impose this constraint by finetuning the generative model with a set of anchor images that capture the characteristics of the input image. With the constrained space, we can then leverage the sampling strat-egy used for generation to do image restoration. We evaluate against previous methods and show superior performances on multiple real-world restoration datasets in preserving identity and image quality. We also demonstrate an important and practical application on personalized restoration, where we use a personal album as the anchor images to constrain the generative space.

{"title": "Efficient Multi-Scale Network with Learnable Discrete Wavelet Transform for Blind Motion Deblurring", "abstract": "Coarse-to-fine schemes are widely used in traditional single-image motion deblur; however, in the context of deep learning, existing multi-scale algorithms not only require the use of complex modules for feature fusion of low-scale RGB images and deep semantics, but also manually generate low-resolution pairs of images that do not have sufficient confidence. In this work, we propose a multi-scale network based on single-input and multiple-outputs(SIMO) for motion deblurring. This simplifies the complexity of algorithms based on a coarse-to-fine scheme. To alleviate restoration defects impacting detail information brought about by using a multi-scale architecture, we combine the characteristics of real-world blurring trajectories with a learnable wavelet transform module to focus on the directional continuity and frequency features of the step-by-step transitions between blurred images to sharp images. In conclusion, we propose a multi-scale network with a learnable discrete wavelet transform (MLWNet), which exhibits state-of-the-art performance on multiple real-world deblurred datasets, in terms of both subjective and objective quality as well as computational efficiency.

{"title": "Efficient Scene Recovery Using Luminous Flux Prior", "abstract": "Scene recovery, the restoration of images degraded by adverse weather conditions, presents significant challenges for existing methods. Physical models, constrained by their inherent assumptions, often fail when these assumptions are not met; Deep learning models are powerful, they are limited by the diversity of their training datasets, leading to poor generalization and high computational demands. To address these limitations, we propose the Luminous Flux Prior (LFP), to recover degraded images under diverse adverse weather without learning. Luminous flux, a physical measure that reflects image brightness, has a rate of change that demonstrates a significant correlation with transmission. Consequently, we leverage this rate of change in luminous flux as prior knowledge to estimate transmission, which in turn assists in image recovery. This approach reduces dependency on physical parameters and enhances adaptability to various weather. Experimental validation under diverse conditions, such as sandstorms, underwater environments, and haze, attests to the robustness of LFP in restoring clear images.

{"title": "Perception-Oriented Video Frame Interpolation via Asymmetric Blending", "abstract": "Previous methods for Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) have encountered challenges, notably the manifestation of blur and ghosting effects. These issues can be traced back to two pivotal factors: unavoidable motion errors and misalignment in supervision. In practice, motion estimates often prove to be error-prone, resulting in misaligned features. Furthermore, the reconstruction loss tends to bring blurry results, particularly in misaligned regions. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a new paradigm called PerVFI (Perception-oriented Video Frame Interpolation). Our approach incorporates an Asymmetric Synergistic Blending module (ASB) that utilizes features from both sides to synergistically blend intermediate features. One reference frame emphasizes primary content, while the other contributes complementary information. To impose a stringent constraint on the blending process, we introduce a self-learned sparse quasi-binary mask which effectively mitigates ghosting and blur artifacts in the output. Additionally, we employ a normalizing flow-based generator and utilize the negative log-likelihood loss to learn the conditional distribution of the output, which further facilitates the generation of clear and fine details. Experimental results validate the superiority of PerVFI, demonstrating significant improvements in perceptual quality compared to existing methods.

In this paper, we propose a modular BVQA model and a method of training it to improve its modularity. Our model comprises a base quality predictor, a spatial rectifier, and a temporal rectifier, responding to the visual content and distortion, spatial resolution, and frame rate changes on video quality, respectively. During training, spatial and temporal rectifiers are dropped out with some probabilities to render the base quality predictor a standalone BVQA model, which should work better with the rectifiers.

{"title": "Residual Denoising Diffusion Models", "abstract": "We propose residual denoising diffusion models (RDDM), a novel dual diffusion process that decouples the traditional single denoising diffusion process into residual diffusion and noise diffusion. This dual diffusion framework expands the denoising-based diffusion models, initially uninterpretable for image restoration, into a unified and interpretable model for both image generation and restoration by introducing residuals. Specifically, our residual diffusion represents directional diffusion from the target image to the degraded input image and explicitly guides the reverse generation process for image restoration, while noise diffusion represents random perturbations in the diffusion process. The residual prioritizes certainty, while the noise emphasizes diversity, enabling RDDM to effectively unify tasks with varying certainty or diversity requirements, such as image generation and restoration. We demonstrate that our sampling process is consistent with that of DDPM and DDIM through coefficient transformation, and propose a partially path-independent generation process to better understand the reverse process.

Although yielding impressive results, the impact of the language prior, particularly in terms of generalization and robustness, remains unexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by quantifying the impact of this prior and introduce methods to benchmark its effectiveness across various settings. We generate “low-level” sentences that convey object-centric, three-dimensional spatial relationships, incorporate them as additional language priors and evaluate their downstream impact on depth estimation. Our key finding is that current language-guided depth estimators perform optimally only with scene-level descriptions and counter-intuitively fare worse with low level descriptions. Despite leveraging additional data, these methods are not robust to directed adversarial attacks and decline in performance with an increase in distribution shift. Finally, to provide a foundation for future research, we identify points of failures and offer insights to better understand these shortcomings.

The transformation process, from one blurry state to another, leverages unpaired data consisting of sharp and blurry images captured by the target camera device. Learning this blur-to-blur transformation is inherently simpler than direct blur-to-sharp conversion, as it primarily involves modifying blur patterns rather than the intricate task of reconstructing fine image details.

{"title": "Exploring Efficient Asymmetric Blind-Spots for Self-Supervised Denoising in Real-World Scenarios", "abstract": "Self-supervised denoising has attracted widespread at-tention due to its ability to train without clean images. How-ever, noise in real-world scenarios is often spatially cor-related, which causes many self-supervised algorithms that assume pixel-wise independent noise to perform poorly. Re-cent works have attempted to break noise correlation with downsampling or neighborhood masking. However, denoising on downsampled subgraphs can lead to aliasing effects and loss of details due to a lower sampling rate. Further-more, the neighborhood masking methods either come with high computational complexity or do not consider local spatial preservation during inference. Through the analy-sis of existing methods, we point out that the key to obtaining high-quality and texture-rich results in real-world self-supervised denoising tasks is to train at the original input resolution structure and use asymmetric operations during training and inference. Based on this, we propose Asymmet-ric Tunable Blind-Spot Network (AT-BSN), where the blind-spot size can be freely adjusted, thus better balancing noise correlation suppression and image local spatial destruction during training and inference. In addition, we regard the pre-trained AT-BSN as a meta-teacher network capable of generating various teacher networks by sampling different blind-spots. We propose a blind-spot based multi-teacher distillation strategy to distill a lightweight network, signif-icantly improving performance.

{"title": "Deep Equilibrium Diffusion Restoration with Parallel Sampling", "abstract": "Diffusion model-based image restoration (IR) aims to use diffusion models to recover high-quality (HQ) images from degraded images, achieving promising performance. Due to the inherent property of diffusion models, most existing methods need long serial sampling chains to restore HQ images step-by-step, resulting in expensive sampling time and high computation costs. Moreover, such long sampling chains hinder understanding the relationship between inputs and restoration results since it is hard to compute the gra-dients in the whole chains. In this work, we aim to rethink the diffusion model-based IR models through a different per-spective, i.e., a deep equilibrium (DEQ) fixed point system, called DeqIR. Specifically, we derive an analytical solution by modeling the entire sampling chain in these IR models as a joint multivariate fixed point system. Based on the analyti-cal solution, we can conduct parallel sampling and restore HQ images without training. Furthermore, we compute fast gradients via DEQ inversion and found that initialization optimization can boost image quality and control the gen-eration direction.

However, annotating the Mean opinion score (MOS) for videos is expensive and time-consuming, which limits the scale of VQA datasets, and poses a significant obstacle for deep learning-based methods. In this paper, we propose a VQA method named PTM-VQA, which leverages PreTrained Models to transfer knowledge from models pretrained on various pre-tasks, enabling benefits for VQA from different aspects. Specifically, we extract features of videos from different pretrained models with frozen weights and integrate them to generate representation. Since these models possess var-ious fields of knowledge and are often trained with labels irrelevant to quality, we propose an Intra-Consistency and Inter-Divisibility (ICID) loss to impose constraints on features extracted by multiple pretrained models. The intra-consistency constraint ensures that features extracted by different pretrained models are in the same unified quality-aware latent space, while the inter-divisibility introduces pseudo clusters based on the annotation of samples and tries to separate features of samples from different clusters. Furthermore, with a constantly growing number of pretrained models, it is crucial to determine which models to use and how to use them. To address this problem, we propose an efficient scheme to select suitable candidates. Models with better clustering performance on VQA datasets are chosen to be our candidates.

Although significant research progress has been made, most existing methods ignore the effect that downstream tasks play in promoting upstream de-hazing. From the perspective of the haze generation mechanism, there is a potential relationship between the depth information of the scene and the hazy image. Based on this, we propose a dual-task collaborative mutual promotion framework to achieve the dehazing of a single image. This framework integrates depth estimation and de-hazing by a dual-task interaction mechanism and achieves mutual enhancement of their performance. To realize the joint optimization of the two tasks, an alternative imple-mentation mechanism with the difference perception is developed. On the one hand, the difference perception between the depth maps of the dehazing result and the ideal image is proposed to promote the dehazing network to pay attention to the non-ideal areas of the dehazing. On the other hand, by improving the depth estimation performance in the difficult-to-recover areas of the hazy image, the de-hazing network can explicitly use the depth information of the hazy image to assist the clear image recovery. To promote the depth estimation, we propose to use the difference between the dehazed image and the ground truth to guide the depth estimation network to focus on the de-hazed unideal areas. It allows dehazing and depth estimation to leverage their strengths in a mutually reinforcing manner.

Hence, we combine the advantages of images in detail description and ones of text in degradation removal to perform restoration. To address the cross-modal assistance, we propose to map the degraded images into textual representations for removing the degradations, and then convert the restored textual representations into a guidance image for assisting image restoration.

In this paper, we propose a new camera exposure control framework that rapidly controls camera exposure while performing real-time processing by exploiting deep reinforcement learning. The proposed framework consists of four contributions: 1) a simplified training ground to simulate real-world's diverse and dynamic lighting changes, 2) flickering and image attribute-aware reward design, along with lightweight state design for real-time processing, 3) a static-to-dynamic lighting curriculum to gradually improve the agent's exposure-adjusting capability, and 4) domain randomization techniques to alleviate the limitation of the training ground and achieve seamless generalization in the wild. As a result, our proposed method rapidly reaches a desired exposure level within five steps with real-time processing (1ms). Also, the acquired images are well-exposed and show superiority in various computer vision tasks, such as feature extraction and object detection.", "keywords": "Training, Computer vision, Lighting, Process control, Object detection, Cameras, Deep reinforcement learning", "authors": "Kyunghyun Lee, Ukcheol Shin, Byeong-Uk Lee"}
{"title": "Real-Time Exposure Correction via Collaborative Transformations and Adaptive Sampling", "abstract": "Most of the previous exposure correction methods learn dense pixel-wise transformations to achieve promising results, but consume huge computational resources. Recently, Learnable 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) have demon-strated impressive performance and efficiency for image enhancement. However, these methods can only perform global transformations and fail to finely manipulate local regions. Moreover, they uniformly downsample the input image, which loses the rich color information and limits the learning of color transformation capabilities. In this paper, we present a collaborative transformation framework (CoTF) for real-time exposure correction, which integrates global transformation with pixel-wise transformations in an efficient manner. Specifically, the global transformation adjusts the overall appearance using image-adaptive 3D LUTs to provide decent global contrast and sharp details, while the pixel transformation compensates for local context. Then, a relation-aware modulation module is designed to combine these two components effectively. In addition, we propose an adaptive sampling strategy to preserve more color information by predicting the sampling intervals, thus providing higher quality input data for the learning of 3D LUTs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can process high-resolution images in real-time on GPUs while achieving comparable performance against current state-of-the-art methods.

{"title": "Towards Progressive Multi-Frequency Representation for Image Warping", "abstract": "Image warping, a classic task in computer vision, aims to use geometric transformations to change the appearance of images. Recent methods learn the resampling kernels for warping through neural networks to estimate missing values in irregular grids, which, however, fail to capture local variations in deformed content and produce images with distortion and less high-frequency details. To address this issue, this paper proposes an effective method, namely MFR, to learn Multi-Frequency Representations from in-put images for image warping. Specifically, we propose a progressive filtering network to learn image representations from different frequency subbands and generate deformable images in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, we employ learnable Gabor wavelet filters to improve the model's capability to learn local spatial-frequency representations. Comprehensive experiments, including homography trans-formation, equirectangular to perspective projection, and asymmetric image super-resolution, demonstrate that the proposed MFR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image warping methods.

Existing model-based methods have limitations in accurately modeling the com-plex image characteristics with handcraft priors, and deep learning-based methods suffer from poor generalization ability. To alleviate these issues, this paper proposes an unsupervised HSI restoration framework with pre-trained diffusion model (HIR-Diff), which restores the clean HSls from the product of two low-rank components, i.e., the re-duced image and the coefficient matrix. Specifically, the re-duced image, which has a low spectral dimension, lies in the image field and can be inferred from our improved diffusion model where a new guidance function with total variation (TV) prior is designed to ensure that the reduced image can be well sampled. The coefficient matrix can be effectively pre-estimated based on singular value decomposition (SVD) and rank-revealing QR (RRQR) factorization. Fur-thermore, a novel exponential noise schedule is proposed to accelerate the restoration process (about 5 x acceleration for denoising) with little performance decrease.

The proposed method is independent of training data and noise distribution. Guided by illumination, we integrate denoising and enhancing processes seamlessly, enabling end-to-end training. Pairs of downsampled images are extracted from a single original low-light image and processed to preliminarily reduce noise. Based on the smoothness of illumination, near-authentic illumination can be estimated from the denoised low-light image. Specifically, the illumi-nation is constrained by the denoised image's brightness, uniformly amplifying pixels to raise overall brightness to normal-light level. We simultaneously restrict the illumi-nation by scaling each pixel of the denoised image based on its intensity, controlling the enhancement amplitude for different pixels. Applying the illumination to the original low-light image yields an adaptively enhanced reflection. This prevents under-enhancement and localized overexpo-sure. Notably, we concatenate the reflection with the illumi-nation, preserving their computational relationship, to ul-timately remove noise from the original low-light image in the form of reflection. This provides sufficient image infor-mation for the denoising procedure without changing the noise characteristics.

To address this issue, we propose the Continuous Optical Zooming dataset (COZ), by constructing an automatic imaging system to collect images at fine-grained various focal lengths within a specific range and providing strict image pair alignment. The COZ dataset serves as a benchmark to provide real-world data for training and testing arbitrary-scale SR models.

The extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the arbitrary-scale SR models trained on the COZ dataset compared to models trained on simulated data.

To address these challenges, a novel event-based key-point detection method is proposed by learning dynamic de-tectors and contextual descriptors in a self-supervised manner (SD2Event), including a contextual feature descriptor learning (CFDL) module and a dynamic keypoint detector learning (DKDL) module. The proposed SD2Event enjoys several merits. First, the proposed CFDL module can model long-range contexts efficiently and effectively.

SAM follows a pipeline that separates interactive segmentation into image preprocessing through a large encoder and interactive inference via a lightweight decoder, ensuring efficient real-time performance. However, SAM faces stability issues in challenging samples upon this pipeline. These issues arise from two main factors. Firstly, the image preprocessing disables SAM to dynamically use image-level zoom-in strategies to refocus on the target object during interaction. Secondly, the lightweight decoder struggles to sufficiently integrate interactive information with image embeddings. To address these two limitations, we propose FocSAM with a pipeline redesigned on two pivotal aspects.

SAM, known for its zero-shot generalizability, exhibits a performance degradation when faced with datasets with varying image sizes. Previous approaches tend to resize the image to a fixed size or adopt structure modifications, hindering the preservation of SAM's rich prior knowledge. Besides, such task-specific tuning necessitates a complete retraining of the model, which is cost-expensive and unacceptable for deployment in the downstream tasks. In this paper, we reformulate this challenge as a length extrapolation problem, where token sequence length varies while maintaining a consistent patch size for images with different sizes. To this end, we propose a Scalable Bias-Mode Attention Mask (BA-SAM) to enhance SAM's adaptability to varying image resolutions while eliminating the need for structure modifications. Firstly, we introduce a new scaling factor to ensure consistent magnitude in the attention layer's dot product values when the token sequence length changes. Secondly, we present a bias-mode attention mask that allows each token to prioritize neighboring information, mitigating the impact of untrained distant information.

UniVS averages the prompt features of the target from previous frames as its initial query to explicitly decode masks, and introduces a target-wise prompt crossattention layer in the mask decoder to integrate prompt features in the memory pool. By taking the predicted masks of entities from previous frames as their visual prompts, UniVS converts different VS tasks into prompt-guided target segmentation, eliminating the heuristic inter-frame matching process. Our framework not only unifies the different VS tasks but also naturally achieves universal training and testing, ensuring robust performance across different scenarios. UniVS shows a commendable balance between performance and universality on 10 challenging VS benchmarks, covering video instance, semantic, panoptic, object, and referring segmentation tasks.

In this paper, we propose RankED, a unified ranking-based approach that addresses both the imbalance problem (P 1) and the uncertainty problem (P2). RankED tackles these two problems with two components: One component which ranks positive pixels over negative pixels, and the second which promotes high confidence edge pixels to have more label certainty.

This paper introduces a pioneering framework tai-lored for low-light VOS, leveraging event camera data to elevate segmentation accuracy. Our approach hinges on two pivotal components: the Adaptive Cross-Modal Fusion (ACMF) module, aimed at extracting pertinent features while fusing image and event modalities to mitigate noise interference, and the Event-Guided Memory Matching (EGMM) module, designed to rectify the issue of in-accurate matching prevalent in low-light settings. Additionally, we present the creation of a synthetic LLE-DAVIS dataset and the curation of a real-world LLE-vas dataset, encompassing frames and events.

To alleviate the annotation burden, contrastive learning has attracted increasing attention for tackling semi-supervised 3D semantic segmentation. However, existing point-to-point contrastive learning techniques in literature are generally sensitive to outliers, resulting in insufficient modeling of the point-wise representations. To address this problem, we propose a method named DDSemi for semi-supervised 3D semantic segmentation, where a density-guided contrastive learning technique is explored. This technique calculates the contrastive loss in a point-to-anchor manner by estimating an anchor for each class from the memory bank based on the finding that the cluster centers tend to be located in dense regions. In this technique, an inter-contrast loss is derived from the perturbed unlabeled point cloud pairs, while an intra-contrast loss is derived from a single unlabeled point cloud. The derived losses could enhance the discriminability of the features and implicitly constrain the semantic consistency between the perturbed unlabeled point cloud pairs. In addition, we propose a dual-space hardness sampling strategy to pay more attention to the hard samples located in sparse regions of both the geometric space and feature space by reweighting the point-wise intra-contrast loss. Experimental results on both indoor-scene and outdoor-scene datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the comparative state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods.", "keywords": "Point cloud compression, Computer vision, Three-dimensional displays, Annotations, Semantic segmentation, Semantics, Contrastive learning", "authors": "Jianan Li, Qiulei Dong"}

Recent research has primarily focused on consistency regularization techniques, exploring perturbation-invariant training at both the image and feature levels. In this work, we proposed a novel feature-level consistency learning framework named Density-Descending Feature Perturbation (DDFP). Inspired by the low-density separation assumption in semi-supervised learning, our key insight is that feature density can shed a light on the most promising direction for the segmentation classifier to explore, which is the regions with lower density. We propose to shift features with confident predictions towards lower-density regions by perturbation injection. The perturbed features are then super-vised by the predictions on the original features, thereby compelling the classifier to explore less dense regions to effectively regularize the decision boundary. Central to our method is the estimation of feature density. To this end, we introduce a lightweight density estimator based on normalizing flow, allowing for efficient capture of the feature density distribution in an online manner. By extracting gradients from the density estimator, we can determine the direction towards less dense regions for each feature. The proposed DDFP outperforms other designs on feature-level perturbations and shows state of the art performances on both Pascal VOC and Cityscapes dataset under various partition protocols.

{"title": "Hunting Attributes: Context Prototype-Aware Learning for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation", "abstract": "Recent weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods strive to incorporate contextual knowledge to improve the completeness of class activation maps (CAM). In this work, we argue that the knowledge bias between instances and contexts affects the capability of the prototype to sufficiently understand instance semantics. Inspired by prototype learning theory, we propose leveraging prototype awareness to capture diverse and fine-grained feature attributes of instances. The hypothesis is that contextual prototypes might erroneously activate similar and frequently co-occurring object categories due to this knowledge bias. Therefore, we propose to enhance the prototype representation ability by mitigating the bias to better capture spatial coverage in semantic object regions. With this goal, we present a Context Prototype-Aware Learning (CPAL) strategy, which leverages semantic context to enrich instance comprehension. The core of this method is to accurately capture intra-class variations in object features through context-aware prototypes, facilitating the adaptation to the semantic attributes of various instances. We design feature distribution alignment to optimize prototype awareness, aligning instance feature distributions with dense features. In addition, a unified training framework is proposed to combine label-guided classification supervision and prototypes-guided self-supervision.

We prove that in the logistic regression problem, SCVRM can be seen as a Vicinal Risk Minimisation plus a regularisation term that penalises the over-confident predictions. In practical implementation, SCVRM is approximated using Monte Carlo sampling that samples additional augmented training images and labels from the vicinal distributions.

Despite recent progress with deep learning models, the dynamic nature of real-world applications necessitates continual learning, where models adapt to new classes (plasticity) over time without forgetting old ones (catastrophic forgetting). Current continual segmentation methods often rely on distillation strategies like knowledge distillation and pseudo-labeling, which are effective but result in increased training complexity and computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce a novel and efficient method for continual panoptic segmentation based on Visual Prompt Tuning, dubbed ECLIPSE. Our approach involves freezing the base model parameters and fine-tuning only a small set of prompt embeddings, addressing both catastrophic forgetting and plasticity and significantly reducing the trainable parameters. To mitigate inherent challenges such as error propagation and semantic drift in continual segmentation, we propose logit manipulation to effectively leverage common knowledge across the classes.

Inspired by clustering-based segmen-tation techniques, S2VNet makes full use of the slice-wise structure of volumetric data by initializing cluster centers from the cluster results of previous slice. This enables knowl-edge acquired from prior slices to assist in the segmentation of the current slice, further efficiently bridging the communication between remote slices using mere 2D networks. Moreover, such a framework readily accommodates inter-active segmentation with no architectural change, simply by initializing centroids from user inputs. S2VNet distin-guishes itselfby swift inference speeds and reduced memory consumption compared to prevailing 3D solutions.

Subsequently, we design two plug-in modules to directly enhance effective bandwidth and receptive field size. The Adaptive Kernel (AdaKern) module decomposes convolution weights into low-frequency and high-frequency components, dynamically adjusting the ratio between these components on a per-channel basis. By increasing the high-frequency part of convolution weights, AdaKern captures more high-frequency components, thereby improving effective bandwidth. The Frequency Selection (FreqSelect) module optimally balances high- and low-frequency components in feature representations through spatially variant reweighting. It suppresses high frequencies in the background to encourage FADC to learn a larger dilation, thereby increasing the receptive field for an expanded scope.

To learn to infer these tissues, we tackle several key challenges. We first create a dataset of human tissues by segmenting full-body MRI scans and registering the SMPL body mesh to the body surface. With this dataset, we train HIT (Human Implicit Tissues), an implicit function that, given a point inside a body, predicts its tissue class. HIT leverages the SMPL body model shape and pose parameters to canonicalize the medical data. Unlike SMPL, which is trained from upright 3D scans, MRI scans are acquired with subjects lying on a table, resulting in significant soft-tissue deformation. Consequently, HIT uses a learned volumetric deformation field that undoes these deformations. Since HIT is parameterized by SMPL, we can repose bodies or change the shape of subjects and the internal structures deform appropriately. We perform extensive experiments to validate HIT's ability to predict a plausible internal structure for novel subjects. The dataset and HIT model are available at https://hit.is.tue.mpg.de to foster future research in this direction.", "keywords": "Three-dimensional displays, Shape, Deformation, Magnetic resonance imaging, Computational modeling, Muscles, Pattern recognition", "authors": "Marilyn Keller, Vaibhav Arora, Abdelmouttaleb Dakri, Shivam Chandhok, Jürgen Machann, Andreas Fritsche, Michael J.

{"title": "Open-Vocabulary Segmentation with Semantic-Assisted Calibration", "abstract": "This paper studies open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) through calibrating in-vocabulary and domain-biased embedding space with generalized contextual prior of CLIP. As the core of open-vocabulary understanding, alignment of visual content with the semantics of unbounded text has become the bottleneck of this field. To address this challenge, recent works propose to utilize CLIP as an additional classifier and aggregate model predictions with CLIP classification results. Despite their remarkable progress, performance of OVS methods in relevant scenarios is still unsatisfactory compared with supervised counterparts. We attribute this to the in-vocabulary embedding and domain-biased CLIP prediction. To this end, we present a Semantic-assisted CAlibration Network (SCAN). In SCAN, we incor-porate generalized semantic prior of CLIP into proposal embedding to avoid collapsing on known categories. Besides, a contextual shift strategy is applied to mitigate the lack of global context and unnatural background noise. With above designs, SCAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on all popular open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks. Furthermore, we also focus on the problem of existing evaluation system that ignores semantic duplication across categories, and propose a new metric called Semantic-Guided IoU (SG-IoU).

{"title": "GraCo: Granularity-Controllable Interactive Segmentation", "abstract": "Interactive Segmentation (IS) segments specific objects or parts in the image according to user input. Current IS pipelines fall into two categories: single-granularity out-put and multi-granularity output. The latter aims to allevi-ate the spatial ambiguity present in the former. However, the multi-granularity output pipeline suffers from limited interaction flexibility and produces redundant results. In this work, we introduce Granularity-Controllable Interactive Segmentation (GraCo), a novel approach that allows precise control of prediction granularity by introducing ad-ditional parameters to input. This enhances the customization of the interactive system and eliminates redundancy while resolving ambiguity. Nevertheless, the exorbitant cost of annotating multi-granularity masks and the lack of avail-able datasets with granularity annotations make it difficult for models to acquire the necessary guidance to control out-put granularity. To address this problem, we design an any-granularity mask generator that exploits the semantic property of the pre-trained IS model to automatically gen-erate abundant mask-granularity pairs without requiring additional manual annotation. Based on these pairs, we propose a granularity-controllable learning strategy that efficiently imparts the granularity controllability to the IS model. Extensive experiments on intricate scenarios at ob-ject and part levels demonstrate that our GraCo has signifi-cant advantages over previous methods. This highlights the potential of GraCo to be a flexible annotation tool, capable of adapting to diverse segmentation scenarios.

{"title": "Unleashing the Potential of SAM for Medical Adaptation via Hierarchical Decoding", "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered significant attention for its versatile segmentation abilities and intuitive prompt-based interface. However, its application in medical imaging presents challenges, requiring either substantial training costs and extensive medical datasets for full model fine-tuning or high-quality prompts for optimal performance. This paper introduces H-SAM: a prompt-free adaptation of SAM tailored for efficient fine-tuning of medical images via a two-stage hierarchical decoding procedure. In the initial stage, H-SAM employs SAM's original decoder to generate a prior probabilistic mask, guiding a more intricate decoding process in the second stage. Specifically, we propose two key designs: 1) A class-balanced, mask-guided self-attention mechanism addressing the unbalanced label distribution, enhancing image embedding; 2) A learnable mask cross-attention mechanism spatially modulating the interplay among different image regions based on the prior mask. Moreover, the inclusion of a hierarchical pixel decoder in H-SAM enhances its proficiency in capturing fine-grained and localized details. This approach enables SAM to effectively integrate learned medical priors, facilitating enhanced adaptation for medical image segmentation with limited samples. Our H-SAM demonstrates a 4.78% improvement in average Dice compared to existing prompt-free SAM variants for multi-organ segmentation using only 10% of 2D slices. Notably, without using any unlabeled data, H-SAM even outperforms state-of-the-art semisupervised models relying on extensive unlabeled training data across various medical datasets.

Among them, leveraging self-supervised Vision Transformers for unsupervised semantic segmentation (USS) has been making steady progress with expressive deep features. Yet, for semantically segmenting images with complex objects, a predominant challenge remains: the lack of explicit object-level semantic encoding in patch-level features. This technical limitation often leads to inadequate segmentation of complex objects with diverse structures. To address this gap, we present a novel approach, EAGLE, which emphasizes object-centric representation learning for unsupervised semantic segmentation. Specifically, we introduce EiCue, a spectral technique providing semantic and structural cues through an eigenbasis derived from the semantic similarity matrix of deep image features and color affinity from an image. Further, by incor-porating our object-centric contrastive loss with EiCue, we guide our model to learn object-level representations with intra- and inter-image object-feature consistency, thereby enhancing semantic accuracy.

Limited by the inherent ambiguity of Class Activation Map (CAM), we observe that one-stage pipelines often encounter confirmation bias caused by incorrect CAM pseudo-labels, impairing their final segmentation performance. Although recent works discard many unreliable pseudo-labels to implicitly alleviate this issue, they fail to exploit sufficient supervision for their models. To this end, we propose a dual student framework with trustworthy progressive learning (DuPL). Specifically, we propose a dual student network with a discrepancy loss to yield diverse CAMs for each sub-net. The two sub-nets generate supervision for each other, mitigating the confirmation bias caused by learning their own incorrect pseudo-labels. In this process, we progressively introduce more trustworthy pseudo-labels to be involved in the supervision through dynamic threshold adjustment with an adaptive noise filtering strategy. Moreover, we believe that every pixel, even discarded from supervision due to its unreliability, is important for WSSS. Thus, we develop consistency regularization on these discarded regions, providing supervision of every pixel.

{"title": "Vanishing-Point-Guided Video Semantic Segmentation of Driving Scenes", "abstract": "The estimation of implicit cross-frame correspondences and the high computational cost have long been major chal-lenges in video semantic segmentation (VSS) for driving scenes. Prior works utilize keyframes, feature propagation, or cross-frame attention to address these issues. By contrast, we are the first to harness vanishing point (VP) priors for more effective segmentation. Intuitively, objects near VPs (i.e., away from the vehicle) are less discernible. Moreover, they tend to move radially away from the VP over time in the usual case of a forward-facing camera, a straight road, and linear forward motion of the vehicle. Our novel, efficient network for VSS, named VPSeg, incor-porates two modules that utilize exactly this pair of static and dynamic VP priors: sparse-to-dense feature mining (DenseVP) and VP-guided motion fusion (MotionVP). MotionVP employs VP-guided motion estimation to establish explicit correspondences across frames and help attend to the most relevant features from neighboring frames, while Dense Vp enhances weak dynamic features in distant re-gions around VPs. These modules operate within a context-detail framework, which separates contextual features from high-resolution local features at different input resolutions to reduce computational costs. Contextual and local fea-tures are integrated through contextualized motion attention (CMA) for the final prediction. Extensive experiments on two popular driving segmentation benchmarks, Cityscapes and ACDC, demonstrate that VPSeg outperforms previous SOTA methods, with only modest computational overhead.

Recent research has explored large-scale supervised training to enable zero- shot transfer segmentation on virtually any image style and unsupervised training to enable segmentation without dense annotations. However, constructing a model capable of segmenting anything in a zero-shot manner without any anno-tations is still challenging. In this paper, we propose to uti-lize the self-attention layers in stable diffusion models to achieve this goal because the pre-trained stable diffusion model has learned inherent concepts of objects within its attention layers.

They are typically trained in-domain, forego large-scale 2D pre-training and outperform alternatives that featurize the posed RGB- D multiview images instead. The gap in performance between methods that consume posed images versus post- processed 3D point clouds has fueled the belief that 2D and 3D perception require distinct model architectures. In this paper, we challenge this view and propose ODIN (Omni-Dimensional INstance segmentation), a model that can segment and label both 2D RGB images and 3D point clouds, using a transformer architecture that alternates between 2D within-view and 3D cross-view information fusion.

{"title": "Infer from What You Have Seen Before: Temporally-dependent Classifier for Semi-supervised Video Segmentation", "abstract": "Due to high expense of human labor, one major challenge for semantic segmentation in real-world scenarios is the lack of sufficient pixel-level labels, which is more serious when processing video data. To exploit unlabeled data for model training, semi-supervised learning methods attempt to construct pseudo labels or various auxiliary constraints as supervision signals. However, most of them just process video data as a set of independent images in a per-frame manner. The rich temporal relationships are ignored, which can serve as valuable clues for representation learning. Besides, this per-frame recognition paradigm is quite different from that of humans. Actually, benefited from the internal temporal relevance of video data, human would wisely use the distinguished semantic concepts in historical frames to aid the recognition of the current frame. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel temporally-dependent classifier (TDC) to mimic the human-like recognition procedure. Comparing to the conventional classifier, TDC can guide the model to learn a group of temporally-consistent semantic concepts across frames, which essentially provides an implicit and effective constraint.

By infusing the class tokens from images, we guide class tokens to pos-sess class-specific distinct characteristics and global-local consistency. For this, we devise two kinds of token infusion: 1) Intra-image Class Token Infusion (I-CTI) and 2) Cross-image Class Token Infusion (C-CTI).

In C-CTI, by infusing the class tokens from the other images and imposing the resulting CAMs to be similar, it learns class-specific distinct characteristics. Besides the CTI, we bring the background (BG) concept into ViT with the BG token to reduce the false positive activation of CAMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in weakly supervised semantic segmentation.

However, attributed to the frequent coupling of co-occurring objects and the limited supervision from image-level labels, the challenging co-occurrence problem is widely present and leads to false activation of objects in WSSS. In this work, we devise a ‘Separate and Conquer’ scheme SeCo to tackle this issue from di-mensions of image space and feature space. In the im-age space, we propose to ‘separate’ the co-occurring ob-jects with image decomposition by subdividing images into patches. Importantly, we assign each patch a category tag from Class Activation Maps (CAMs), which spatially helps remove the co-context bias and guide the subsequent rep-resentation.

{"title": "Blur-Aware Spatio-Temporal Sparse Transformer for Video Deblurring", "abstract": "Video deblurring relies on leveraging information from other frames in the video sequence to restore the blurred regions in the current frame. Mainstream approaches employ bidirectional feature propagation, spatio-temporal Transformers, or a combination of both to extract information from the video sequence. However, limitations in memory and computational resources constraints the temporal window length of the spatio-temporal transformer, preventing the extraction of longer temporal contextual information from the video sequence. Additionally, bidirectional feature propagation is highly sensitive to inaccurate optical flow in blurry frames, leading to error accumulation during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose BSSTNet, Blur-aware Spatio-temporal Sparse Transformer Network. It introduces the blur map, which converts the originally dense attention into a sparse form, enabling a more extensive utilization of information throughout the entire video sequence. Specifically, BSSTNet (1) uses a longer temporal window in the transformer, lever-aging information from more distant frames to restore the blurry pixels in the current frame.

{"title": "Style Blind Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation via Covariance Alignment and Semantic Consistence Contrastive Learning", "abstract": "Deep learning models for semantic segmentation often experience performance degradation when deployed to unseen target domains unidentified during the training phase. This is mainly due to variations in image texture (i.e. style) from different data sources. To tackle this challenge, existing domain generalized semantic segmentation (DGSS) methods attempt to remove style variations from the feature. However, these approaches struggle with the entanglement of style and content, which may lead to the unintentional removal of crucial content information, causing performance degradation. This study addresses this limitation by proposing BlindNet, a novel DGSS approach that blinds the style without external modules or datasets. The main idea behind our proposed approach is to alleviate the effect of style in the encoder whilst facilitating robust segmentation in the decoder. To achieve this, BlindNet comprises two key components: covariance alignment and semantic consistency contrastive learning. Specifically, the covariance alignment trains the encoder to uniformly recognize various styles and preserve the content information of the feature, rather than removing the style-sensitive factor. Meanwhile, semantic consistency contrastive learning enables the decoder to construct discriminative class embedding space and disentangles features that are vulnerable to misclassification.

Given a reference image of a certain foreground and guided priors such as points, scribbles, and masks, in-context matting enables automatic alpha estimation on a batch of target images of the same foreground category, without additional auxiliary input. This setting marries good performance in auxiliary input-based matting and ease of use in automatic matting, which finds a good trade-off between customization and automation. To overcome the key challenge of accurate foreground matching, we introduce IconMatting, an in-context matting model built upon a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model.

To benchmark the task, we also introduce a novel testing dataset ICM-57, covering 57 groups of real-world images.

In the computer vision community, PEFT has shown effectiveness in image classification, but little research has studied its ability for image segmentation. Fine-tuning segmentation models usually requires a heavier adjustment of parameters to align the proper projection directions in the parameter space for new scenarios. This raises a challenge to existing PEFT algorithms, as they often inject a limited number of individual parameters into each block, which prevents substantial adjustment of the projection direction of the parameter space due to the limitation of Hidden Markov Chain along blocks. In this paper, we equip PEFT with a cross-block orchestration mechanism to enable the adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to various downstream scenarios. We introduce a novel inter-block communication module, which integrates a learnable relation matrix to facilitate communication among different coefficient sets of each PEFT block's parameter space.

Low-latency and high-quality interactive segmentation with diverse prompts remain challenging for existing specialist and generalist models. Specialist models, with their limited prompts and task-specific designs, experience high latency because the image must be recomputed every time the prompt is updated, due to the joint encoding of image and visual prompts. Generalist models, exemplified by the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have recently excelled in prompt diversity and efficiency, lifting image segmentation to the foundation model era. However, for high-quality segmentations, SAM still lags behind state-of-the-art specialist models despite SAM being trained with ×100 more segmentation masks. In this work, we delve deep into the architectural differences between the two types of models. We observe that dense representation and fusion of visual prompts are the key design choices contributing to the high segmentation quality of specialist models. In light of this, we reintroduce this dense design into the generalist models, to facilitate the development of generalist models with high segmentation quality. To densely represent diverse visual prompts, we propose to use a dense map to capture five types: clicks, boxes, polygons, scribbles, and masks.

A critical hurdle in this endeavor is preventing overfitting to the limited classes seen during training the few-shot segmentation model.

We adapt and refine this concept to craft a relationship descriptor construction tailored for few-shot semantic segmentation, extending its application across multiple layers to enhance performance.

We show that the concept of self-self attention corresponds to clustering, thus enforcing groups of tokens arising from the same object to be similar while preserving the alignment with the language space. To further guide the group formation, we propose a set of regularizations that allows the model to finally generalize across datasets and backbones.

In this work, we propose to replace the visual prior representation with the visual-text alignment capacity to capture more reliable guidance and enhance the model generalization. Specifically, we design two kinds of trainingfree prior information generation strategy that attempts to utilize the semantic alignment capability of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training model (CLIP) to locate the target class. Besides, to acquire more accurate prior guidance, we build a high-order relationship of attention maps and utilize it to refine the initial prior information. Experiments on both the PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets show that our method obtains a clearly substantial improvement and reaches the new state-of-the-art performance.

{"title": "Image-to-Image Matching via Foundation Models: A New Perspective for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation", "abstract": "Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images of arbitrary categories specified by class labels or captions. However, most previous best-performing methods, whether pixel grouping methods or region recognition methods, suffer from false matches between image features and category labels. We attribute this to the natural gap between the textual features and visual features. In this work, we rethink how to mitigate false matches from the perspective of image-to-image matching and propose a novel relation-aware intra-modal matching (RIM) framework for OVS based on visual foundation models. RIM achieves robust region classification by firstly constructing diverse image-modal reference features and then matching them with region features based on relation-aware ranking distribution. The proposed RIM enjoys several merits. First, the intra-modal reference features are better aligned, circumventing potential ambiguities that may arise in cross-modal matching. Second, the ranking-based matching process harnesses the structure information implicit in the inter-class relationships, making it more robust than comparing individually. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that RIM outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, obtaining a lead of more than 10% in mIoU on PASCAL VOC benchmark.", "keywords": "Visualization, Computer vision, Image recognition, Semantic segmentation, Benchmark testing, Lead, Diffusion models", "authors": "Yuan Wang, Rui Sun, Naisong Luo, Yuwen Pan, Tianzhu Zhang"}

In this paper, we propose a novel Domain Separation Graph Neural Network (DSGNN), which starts with separately extracting the shape and texture cues from each object, and builds an shape graph as well as a texture graph for all objects in the given image. Then, we propose a Shape-Texture Graph Domain Separation (STGDS) module to separate the task-relevant and irrelevant information of target objects by explicitly modelling the relationship between each pair of objects in terms of their shapes and textures, respectively. Furthermore, a Cross Image Graph Domain Separation (CIGDS) module is introduced to explore the saliency degree subspace that is robust to different scenes, aiming to create a unified representation for targets with the same saliency levels in different images. Importantly, our DSGNN automatically learns a multi-dimensional feature to represent each graph edge, allowing complex, diverse and ranking-related relationships to be modelled.

Most instance segmentation datasets today require costly manual annotation, limiting their data scale. Models trained on such data are prone to overfitting on the training set, especially for those rare categories. While recent works have delved into exploiting generative models to create synthetic datasets for data augmentation, these approaches do not efficiently harness the full potential of generative models. To address these issues, we introduce a more efficient strategy to construct generative datasets for data augmentation, termed DiverGen. Firstly, we provide an explanation of the role of generative data from the perspective of distribution discrepancy. We investigate the impact of different data on the distribution learned by the model. We argue that generative data can expand the data distribution that the model can learn, thus mitigating overfitting. Additionally, we find that the diversity of generative data is crucial for improving model performance and enhance it through various strategies, including category diversity, prompt diversity, and generative model diversity. With these strategies, we can scale the data to millions while maintaining the trend of model performance improvement. On the LVIS dataset, DiverGen significantly outperforms the strong model X-Paste, achieving +1.1 box AP and +1.1 mask AP across all categories, and +1.9 box AP and +2.5 mask AP for rare categories.

In this work, we introduce Spherical Mask, a novel coarse-to-fine approach based on spherical repre-sentation, overcoming those two limitations with several benefits. Specifically, our coarse detection estimates each in-stance with a 3D polygon using a center and radial distance predictions, which avoids excessive size estimation of AABB. To cut the error propagation in the existing coarse-to-fine approaches, we virtually migrate points based on the polygon, allowing all foreground points, including false negatives, to be refined. During inference, the proposal and point mi-gration modules run in parallel and are assembled to form binary masks of instances. We also introduce two margin-based losses for the point migration to enforce corrections for the false positives/negatives and cohesion of foreground points, significantly improving the performance.

In this paper, we introduce the Universal Segment Embedding (USE) framework to address this challenge. This framework is comprised of two key components: 1) a data pipeline designed to efficiently curate a large amount of segment-text pairs at various granularities, and 2) a universal segment embedding model that enables precise segment classification into a vast range of text-defined categories. The USE model can not only help open-vocabulary image segmentation but also facilitate other downstream tasks (e.g., querying and ranking). Through comprehensive experimental studies on semantic segmentation and part segmentation benchmarks, we demonstrate that the USE framework outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation methods.", "keywords": "Representation learning, Image segmentation, Vocabulary, Computer vision, Semantic segmentation, Scalability, Pipelines", "authors": "Xiaoqi Wang, Wenbin He, Xiwei Xuan, Clint Sebastian, Jorge Piazentin Ono, Xin Li, Sima Behpour, Thang Doan, Liang Gou, Han-Wei Shen, Liu Ren"}

How-ever, due to the randomness in the diffusion process, they often struggle with handling diverse low-level tasks that require details preservation. To overcome this limitation, we present a new Diff-Plugin framework to enable a single pre-trained diffusion model to generate high-fidelity re-sults across a variety of low-level tasks. Specifically, we first propose a lightweight Task-Plugin module with a dual branch design to provide task-specific priors, guiding the diffusion process in preserving image content. We then propose a Plugin-Selector that can automatically select different Task-Plugins based on the text instruction, allowing users to edit images by indicating multiple low-level tasks with natural language. We conduct extensive experiments on 8 low-level vision tasks. The results demonstrate the superiority of Diff-Plugin over existing methods, particu-larly in real-world scenarios.

{"title": "SC-GS: Sparse-Controlled Gaussian Splatting for Editable Dynamic Scenes", "abstract": "Novel view synthesis for dynamic scenes is still a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Recently, Gaussian splatting has emerged as a robust technique to represent static scenes and enable high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. Building upon this technique, we propose a new representation that explicitly decomposes the motion and appearance of dynamic scenes into sparse control points and dense Gaussians, respectively. Our key idea is to use sparse control points, significantly fewer in number than the Gaussians, to learn compact 6 DoF transformation bases, which can be locally interpolated through learned interpolation weights to yield the motion field of 3D Gaussians. We employ a deformation MLP to predict time-varying 6 DoF transformations for each control point, which reduces learning complexities, enhances learning abilities, and facilitates obtaining temporal and spatial coherent motion patterns. Then, we jointly learn the 3D Gaussians, the canonical space locations of control points, and the deformation MLP to reconstruct the appearance, geometry, and dynamics of 3D scenes. During learning, the location and number of control points are adaptively adjusted to accommodate varying motion complexities in different regions, and an ARAP loss following the principle of as rigid as possible is developed to enforce spatial continuity and local rigidity of learned motions. Finally, thanks to the explicit sparse motion representation and its decomposition from appearance, our method can enable user-controlled motion editing while retaining high-fidelity appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing approaches on novel view synthesis with a high rendering speed and enables novel appearance-preserved motion editing applications.", "keywords": "Computer vision, Three-dimensional displays, Deformation, Dynamics, Spatial coherence, Rendering (computer graphics), 6-DOF", "authors": "Yi-Hua Huang, Yang-Tian Sun, Ziyi Yang, Xiaoyang Lyu, Yan-Pei Cao, Xiaojuan Qi"}

Holo-Relighting leverages the pretrained 3D GAN (EG3D) to reconstruct geometry and appearance from an input portrait as a set of 3D-aware features. We design a relighting module conditioned on a given lighting to process these features, and predict a relit 3D representation in the form of a tri-plane, which can render to an arbitrary viewpoint through volume rendering. Besides viewpoint and lighting control, Holo-Relighting also takes the head pose as a condition to enable head-pose-dependent lighting effects. With these novel designs, Holo-Relighting can generate complex non-Lambertian lighting effects (e.g., specular highlights and cast shadows) without using any explicit physical lighting priors. We train Holo-Relighting with data captured with a light stage, and propose two data-rendering techniques to improve the data quality for training the volumetric relighting system.

The formulation we propose not only merges training and filtering in an efficient way, but also generalizes beyond the familiar Euclidean coordinate spaces to the more general set of smooth manifolds and convolutions induced by the actions of Lie groups.

On the one hand, the gener-ation process based on pure vector domain completely ignores the similarity measurement between shape parameter (and their combination) and the paired pixel image appearance pattern; on the other hand, two-stage methods (i.e., generation-and-vectorization) based on pixel diffusion followed by differentiable image-to-vector translation suf-fer from wrong error-correction signal caused by approxi-mate gradients. To address the above issues, we propose a novel generation framework based on dual-domain (vector-pixel) diffusion with cross-modality impulse signals from each other. First, in each diffusion step, the current representation extracted from the other domain is used as a condition variable to constrain the subsequent sampling operation, yielding shape-aware new parameterizations; second, independent supervision signals from both domains avoid the gradient error accumulation problem caused by cross-domain representation conversion.

We demonstrate that TexTile can be plugged into different state-of-the-art texture synthesis methods, in-cluding diffusion-based strategies, and generate tileable textures while keeping or even improving the overall texture quality. Furthermore, we show that TexTile can objectively evaluate any tileable texture synthesis method, whereas the current mix of existing metrics produces uncorrelated scores which heavily hinders progress in the field.", "keywords": "Measurement, Training, Computer vision, Computational modeling, Semantics, Computer architecture, Data augmentation", "authors": "Carlos Rodriguez-Pardo, Dan Casas, Elena Garces, Jorge Lopez-Moreno"}

Within this realm, two typical approaches are employed: rasterization and ray tracing. The rasterization-based methods enable real-time rendering at the cost of increased memory and lower fidelity. In contrast, the ray-tracing-based methods yield superior quality but demand longer rendering time. We solve this problem by our HashPoint method combining these two strategies, leveraging rasterization for efficient point searching and sampling, and ray marching for rendering. Our method optimizes point searching by rasterizing points within the camera's view, organizing them in a hash table, and facilitating rapid searches. Notably, we accelerate the rendering process by adaptive sampling on the primary surface encountered by the ray. Our approach yields substantial speed-up for a range of state-of-the-art ray-tracing-based methods, maintaining equivalent or superior accuracy across synthetic and real test datasets.

This approach improves the quality of both the localization and the stylization. To enhance the details and resolution of the textured area, we leverage multiple stages of a cascaded diffusion model to supervise our local editing technique with generative priors learned from images at different resolutions. Our technique, referred to as Cascaded Score Distillation (CSD), simultaneously distills scores at multiple resolutions in a cascaded fashion, enabling control over both the granularity and global understanding of the supervision.

{"title": "DUDF: Differentiable Unsigned Distance Fields with Hyperbolic Scaling", "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in training Neural Networks to approximate Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) for representing open surfaces in the context of 3D reconstruction. However, UDFs are non-differentiable at the zero level set which leads to significant errors in distances and gradients, generally resulting in fragmented and discontinuous surfaces. In this paper, we propose to learn a hyperbolic scaling of the unsigned distance field, which defines a new Eikonal problem with distinct boundary conditions. This allows our formulation to integrate seamlessly with state-of-the-art continuously differentiable implicit neural representation networks, largely applied in the literature to represent signed distance fields. Our approach not only addresses the challenge of open surface representation but also demonstrates significant improvement in reconstruction quality and training performance. Moreover, the unlocked field's differentiability allows the accurate computation of essential topological properties such as normal directions and curvatures, pervasive in downstream tasks such as rendering. Through extensive experiments, we validate our approach across various data sets and against competitive baselines.

In the process, we produce (diffusion) features in 2D that we subsequently lift and aggregate on the original surface. Our key observation is that even if the conditional image generations obtained from multi-view rendering of the input shapes are inconsistent, the associated image features are robust and, hence, can be directly aggregated across views. This produces semantic features on the input shapes, without requiring additional data or training. We perform extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (SHREC'19, SHREC'20, FAUST, and TOSCA) and demonstrate that our features, being semantic instead of geometric, produce reliable correspondence across both isometric and non-isometrically related shape families.

However, the degree of stylization achieved by existing methods is often not sufficient for practical applications because they are mostly based on statistical 3D Morphable Models (3DMM) with limited variations. To this end, we propose a method that can produce a highly stylized 3D face model with desired topology. Our methods train a surface deformation network with 3DMM and translate its domain to the target style using a paired exemplar. The network achieves stylization of the 3D face mesh by mimicking the style of the target using a differentiable renderer and directional CLIP losses. Additionally, during the inference process, we utilize a Mesh Agnostic Encoder (MAGE) that takes deformation target, a mesh of diverse topologies as input to the stylization process and encodes its shape into our latent space. The resulting stylized face model can be animated by commonly used 3DMM blend shapes. A set of quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our method can produce highly stylized face meshes according to a given style and output them in a desired topology. We also demonstrate example applications of our method including image-based stylized avatar generation, linear interpolation of geometric styles, and facial animation of stylized avatars.", "keywords": "Solid modeling, Interpolation, Three-dimensional displays, Network topology, Deformation, Shape, Face recognition", "authors": "Soyeon Yoon, Kwan Yun, Kwanggyoon Seo, Sihun Cha, Jung Eun Yoo, Junyong Noh"}

When training a diffusion or flow models on 3D shapes a crucial design choice is the shape representation. An effective shape representation needs to adhere three design principles: it should allow an efficient conversion of large 3D datasets to the representation form; it should provide a good tradeoff of approximation power versus number of parameters; and it should have a simple tensorial form that is compatible with existing powerful neural architectures. While standard 3D shape representations such as volumetric grids and point clouds do not adhere to all these principles simultaneously, we advocate in this paper a new representation that does. We introduce Mosaic-SDF (M-SDF): a simple 3D shape representation that approximates the Signed Distance Function (SDF) of a given shape by using a set of local grids spread near the shape's boundary. The M-SDF representation is fast to compute for each shape individually making it readily parallelizable; it is parameter efficient as it only covers the space around the shape's boundary; and it has a simple matrix form, compatible with Transformer-based architectures.

In addition, functional diffusion is especially suited for irregular data or data defined in non-standard domains. In our work, we derive the necessary foundations for functional diffusion and propose a first implementation based on the transformer architecture.

{"title": "FreeU: Free Lunch in Diffusion U-Net", "abstract": "In this paper, we uncover the untapped potential of dif-fusion U-Net, which serves as a “free lunch” that substan-tially improves the generation quality on the fly. We initially investigate the key contributions of the U-Net architecture to the denoising process and identify that its main backbone primarily contributes to denoising, whereas its skip connections mainly introduce high-frequency features into the de-coder module, causing the potential neglect of crucial functions intrinsic to the backbone network. Capitalizing on this discovery, we propose a simple yet effective method, termed “FreeU”, which enhances generation quality without additional training or finetuning. Our key insight is to strategi-cally re-weight the contributions sourced from the U-Net's skip connections and backbone feature maps, to leverage the strengths of both components of the U-Net architec-ture. Promising results on image and video generation tasks demonstrate that our FreeU can be readily integrated to ex-isting diffusion models, e.g., Stable Diffusion, DreamBooth and ControlNet, to improve the generation quality with only a few lines of code.

{"title": "Ranni: Taming Text-to-Image Diffusion for Accurate Instruction Following", "abstract": "Existing text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models usually struggle in interpreting complex prompts, especially those with quantity, object-attribute binding, and multi-subject descriptions. In this work, we introduce a semantic panel as the middleware in decoding texts to images, supporting the generator to better follow instructions. The panel is obtained through arranging the visual concepts parsed from the input text by the aid of large language models, and then injected into the denoising network as a detailed control signal to complement the text condition. To facilitate text-to-panel learning, we come up with a carefully designed semantic formatting protocol, accompanied by a fully-automatic data preparation pipeline. Thanks to such a design, our approach, which we call Ranni, manages to enhance a pre-trained T2I generator regarding its textual controllability. More importantly, the introduction of the generative middleware brings a more convenient form of interaction (i.e., directly adjusting the elements in the panel or using language instructions) and further allows users to finely customize their generation, based on which we develop a practical system and showcase its potential in continuous generation and chatting-based editing.", "keywords": "Visualization, Protocols, Semantics, Pipelines, Text to image, Diffusion models, Generators", "authors": "Yutong Feng, Biao Gong, Di Chen, Yujun Shen, Yu Liu, Jingren Zhou"}

Further, personalized techniques enable appealing customized production of a novel concept given only several images as reference. However, an intriguing problem persists: Is it possible to capture multiple, novel concepts from one single reference image? In this paper, we identify that existing approaches fail to preserve visual consistency with the reference image and eliminate cross-influence from concepts. To alleviate this, we propose an attention calibration mechanism to improve the concept-level understanding of the T2I model. Specifically, we first introduce new learnable modifiers bound with classes to capture attributes of multiple concepts. Then, the classes are separated and strengthened following the activation of the cross-attention operation, ensuring comprehensive and self-contained concepts. Additionally, we suppress the attention activation of different classes to mitigate mutual influence among concepts. Together, our proposed method, dubbed DisenDiff, can learn disentangled multiple concepts from one single image and produce novel customized images with learned concepts.

Prevailing explanations are based on implicit biases of gradient de-scent (GD) but they cannot account for the capabilities of models from gradient-free methods [9] nor the simplicity bias recently observed in untrained networks [29]. This paper seeks other sources of generalization in NNs. Findings. To understand the inductive biases provided by architectures independently from GD, we examine un-trained, random-weight networks. Even simple MLPs show strong inductive biases: uniform sampling in weight space yields a very biased distribution of functions in terms of complexity. But unlike common wisdom, NNs do not have an inherent “simplicity bias”. This property depends on components such as ReLUs, residual connections, and layer normalizations. Alternative architectures can be built with a bias for any level of complexity. Transformers also inherit all these properties from their building blocks. Implications.

SfM is a classic computer vision problem that is solved though iterative minimization of reprojection errors, referred to as Bundle Adjustment (BA), starting from a good initialization. In order to obtain a good enough initial-ization to BA, conventional methods rely on a sequence of sub-problems (such as pairwise pose estimation, pose averaging or triangulation) which provide an initial solution that can then be refined using BA. In this work we re-place these sub-problems by learning a model that takes as input the 2D keypoints detected across multiple views, and outputs the corresponding camera poses and 3D key-point coordinates. Our model takes advantage of graph neural networks to learn SfM-specijic primitives, and we show that it can be used for fast inference of the reconstruction for new and unseen sequences.

A key obstacle that prevents its widespread adoption is the encoding speed-generating neural fields requires an overfitting of a neural network, which can take a significant number of SGD steps to reach the desired fidelity level. In this paper, we delve into the impacts of data transformations on the speed of neural field training, specifically focusing on how permuting pixel locations affect the convergence speed of SGD. Counterintuitively, we find that randomly permuting the pixel locations can considerably accelerate the training. To explain this phenomenon, we examine the neural field training through the lens of PSNR curves, loss landscapes, and error patterns.

In this work, we introduce a novel Visual Prompt-guided text-to-3D diffusion model (VP3D) that explicitly unleashes the visual appearance knowledge in 2D visual prompt to boost text-to-3D generation.

This necessitates some measure of how much an observation “agrees” with a given model. A natural choice is to consider the smallest perturbation that makes the observation exactly satisfy the constraints. However, for many problems, this metric is expensive or otherwise intractable to compute. The so-called Sampson error approximates this geometric error through a linearization scheme. For epipolar geometry, the Sampson error is a popular choice and in practice known to yield very tight approximations of the corresponding geometric residual (the reprojection error). In this paper we revisit the Sampson approximation and provide new theoretical insights as to why and when this approximation works, as well as provide explicit bounds on the tightness under some mild assumptions.

However, fall short of achieving precise user control, often yielding results that do not align with user expectations, thus limiting their applicability. User-envisioning 3D object generation faces significant challenges in realizing its concepts using current generative models due to limited interaction capabilities. Existing methods mainly offer two approaches: (i) interpreting textual instructions with constrained controllability, or (ii) reconstructing 3D objects from 2D images. Both of them limit customization to the confines of the 2D reference and potentially introduce undesirable artifacts during the 3D lifting process, restricting the scope for direct and versatile 3D modifications. In this work, we introduce Interactive3D, an innovative framework for interactive 3D generation that grants users precise control over the generative process through extensive 3D interaction capabilities. Interactive3D is constructed in two cascading stages, utilizing distinct 3D representations. The first stage employs Gaussian Splatting for direct user interaction, allowing modifications and guidance of the generative direction at any intermediate step through (i) Adding and Removing components, (ii) Deformable and Rigid Dragging, (iii) Geometric Transformations, and (iv) Semantic Editing. Subsequently, the Gaussian splats are transformed into InstantNGP. We introduce a novel (v) Interactive Hash Refinement module to further add details and extract the geometry in the second stage.

{"title": "2S-UDF: A Novel Two-Stage UDF Learning Method for Robust Non-Watertight Model Reconstruction from Multi-View Images", "abstract": "Recently, building on the foundation of neural radiance field, various techniques have emerged to learn unsigned distance fields (UDF) to reconstruct 3D non-watertight models from multi-view images. Yet, a central challenge in UDF-based volume rendering is formulating a proper way to convert unsigned distance values into volume density, ensuring that the resulting weight function remains unbiased and sensitive to occlusions. Falling short on these requirements often results in incorrect topology or large reconstruction errors in resulting models. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a novel two-stage algorithm, 2S-UDF, for learning a high-quality UDF from multi-view images. Initially, the method applies an easily trainable density function that, while slightly biased and transparent, aids in coarse reconstruction. The subsequent stage then refines the geometry and appearance of the object to achieve a high-quality reconstruction by directly adjusting the weight function used in volume rendering to ensure that it is unbiased and occlusion-aware. Decoupling density and weight in two stages makes our training stable and robust, distinguishing our technique from existing UDF learning approaches. Evaluations on the DeepFashion3D, DTU, and BlendedMVS datasets validate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed approach.

To model the distribution of 3D edited NeRFs from 2D edited images, we carefully design a VAE-GAN that encodes images while decoding NeRFs. The latent space is trained to align with a Gaussian distribution and the NeRFs are supervised through an adversarial loss on its renderings. To ensure the latent code does not depend on 2D viewpoints but truly reflects the 3D edits, we also regularize the latent code through a contrastive learning scheme.

Different from existing methods which apply stylization to trained neural radiance fields at the voxel level, our approach draws inspiration from image-to-painting methods, simulating the progressive painting process of human artwork with vector strokes. We develop a palette of stylized 3D strokes from basic primitives and splines, and consider the 3D scene stylization task as a multi-view reconstruction process based on these 3D stroke primitives. Instead of directly searching for the parame-ters of these 3D strokes, which would be too costly, we introduce a differentiable renderer that allows optimizing stroke parameters using gradient descent, and propose a training scheme to alleviate the vanishing gradient issue. The extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach effectively synthesizes 3D scenes with significant geomet-ric and aesthetic stylization while maintaining a consis-tent appearance across different views.

Existing methods broadly obey coordinate-based scheme, where inlier con-fidence is scored through simply capturing coordinate differences in the context.

In this paper, we explore to extend a new definition called inlier confidence calibration (ICC) to alleviate the above issues. Firstly, we provide finely initial correspondences for ICC in order to generate high quality reference point cloud copy corresponding to the source point cloud. In particular, we develop a soft assignment matrix optimization theorem that offers faster speed and greater precision compared to Sinkhorn. Benefiting from the high quality reference copy, we argue the neighborhood patch formed by inlier and its neighborhood should have consistency between source point cloud and its reference copy. Based on this insight, we construct transformation-invariant geometric constraints and capture geometric structure consistency to calibrate inlier confidence for estimated correspondences between source point cloud and its reference copy.

This is due to two key reasons: (i) independently inpainting constituent images results in view-inconsistent imagery, and (ii) 2D inpainters struggle to ensure high-quality geometry completion and alignment with inpainted RGB images. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel approach called MVIP-NeRF that harnesses the potential of diffusion priors for NeRF inpainting, addressing both appearance and geometry aspects. MVIP-NeRF performs joint inpainting across multiple views to reach a consistent solution, which is achieved via an iterative optimization process based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). Apart from recovering the rendered RGB images, we also extract normal maps as a geometric representation and define a normal SDS loss that motivates accurate geometry inpaint- ing and alignment with the appearance. Additionally, we formulate a multi-view SDS score function to distill generative priors simultaneously from different view images, ensuring consistent visual completion when dealing with large view variations.

It is however challenging to extract a mesh from the millions of tiny 3D Gaussians as these Gaussians tend to be unorganized after optimization and no method has been proposed so far. Our first key contribution is a regularization term that encourages the Gaussians to align well with the surface of the scene. We then introduce a method that exploits this alignment to extract a mesh from the Gaussians using Poisson reconstruction, which is fast, scalable, and preserves details, in contrast to the Marching Cubes algorithm usually applied to extract meshes from Neural SDFs. Finally, we introduce an optional refinement strategy that binds Gaussians to the surface of the mesh, and jointly optimizes these Gaussians and the mesh through Gaussian splatting rendering. This enables easy editing, sculpting, animating, and relighting of the Gaussians by manipulating the mesh instead of the Gaussians themselves.

With the success of text-to-image diffusion models, the 2D-lifting technique becomes a promising route to controllable 3D generation.

We observe that the problem is caused mainly by two aspects, i.e., viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion models and overfitting of the optimization objective. To address it, we propose a two-stage 2D-lifting framework, namely DreamControl, which optimizes coarse NeRF scenes as 3D self-prior and then generates fine-grained objects with control-based score distillation. Specifically, adaptive viewpoint sampling and boundary integrity metric are proposed to ensure the consistency of generated priors. The priors are then regarded as input conditions to maintain reasonable geometries, in which conditional LoRA and weighted score are further proposed to optimize detailed textures.

Concretely, DITTO consists of dual latent encoder and integrated implicit decoder. In the dual latent encoder, a dual latent layer, which is the key module block composing the encoder, refines both latents in parallel, maintaining their distinct shapes and enabling recursive interaction. Notably, a newly proposed dynamic sparse point transformer within the dual latent layer effectively refines point latents.

To achieve this, current state-of-the-art methods attempt to construct the local rotation-invariant representation through learning or defining the local reference frame (LRF). Although efficient, these LRF-based methods suffer from perturbation of local geometric relations, resulting in suboptimal local rotation invariance. To alleviate this issue, we propose a Local-consistent Transformation (LocoTrans) learning strategy. Specifically, we first construct the local-consistent reference frame (LCRF) by considering the symmetry of the two axes in LRF. In comparison with previous LRFs, our LCRF is able to preserve local geometric relationships better through performing local-consistent transformation. However, as the consistency only exists in local regions, the relative pose information is still lost in the intermediate layers of the network. We mitigate such a relative pose issue by developing a relative pose recovery (RPR) module. RPR aims to restore the relative pose between adjacent transformed patches. Equipped with LCRF and RPR, our LocoTrans is capable of learning local-consistent transformation and preserving local geometry, which benefits rotation invariance learning.

{"title": "Improving Physics-Augmented Continuum Neural Radiance Field-Based Geometry-Agnostic System Identification with Lagrangian Particle Optimization", "abstract": "Geometry-agnostic system identification is a technique for identifying the geometry and physical properties of an object from video sequences without any geometric as-sumptions. Recently, physics-augmented continuum neural radiance fields (PAC-NeRF) has demonstrated promising results for this technique by utilizing a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian representation, in which the geometry is represented by the Eulerian grid representations of NeRF, the physics is described by a material point method (MPM), and they are connected via Lagrangian particles. However, a notable limitation of PAC-NeRF is that its performance is sensitive to the learning of the geometry from the first frames owing to its two-step optimization. First, the grid representations are optimized with the first frames of video sequences, and then the physical properties are optimized through video sequences utilizing the fixed first-frame grid representations. This limitation can be critical when learning of the geometric structure is difficult, for example, in a few-shot (sparse view) setting. To overcome this limitation, we propose Lagrangian particle optimization (LPO), in which the positions and features of particles are opti-mized through video sequences in Lagrangian space. This method allows for the optimization of the geometric structure across the entire video sequence within the physical constraints imposed by the MPM.

Most existing studies are devoted to designing vision-specific transformers to solve the above problems, which introduce additional pre-training costs. Therefore, we present a plain, pre-training-free, and feature-enhanced ViT back-bone with Convolutional Multi-scale feature interaction, named ViT-CoMer, which facilitates bidirectional interaction between CNN and transformer. Compared to the state-of-the-art, ViT-CoMer has the following advantages: (1) We inject spatial pyramid multi-receptive field convolutional features into the ViT architecture, which effectively alleviates the problems of limited local information interaction and single-feature representation in ViT. (2) We propose a simple and efficient CNN- Transformer bidirectional fusion interaction module that performs multi-scale fusion across hierarchical features, which is beneficial for han-dling dense prediction tasks. (3) We evaluate the performance of ViT-CoMer across various dense prediction tasks, different frameworks, and multiple advanced pre-training. Notably, our ViT-CoMer-L achieves 64.3% AP on COCO val2017 without extra training data, and 62.1% mIoU on ADE20K val, both of which are comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

In this paper, we contribute from two aspects. 1) We propose four architectural guidelines for designing large- kernel ConvNets, the core of which is to exploit the essential characteristics of large kernels that distinguish them from small kernels - they can see wide without going deep. Fol-lowing such guidelines, our proposed large-kernel ConvNet shows leading performance in image recognition (ImageNet accuracy of 88.0%, ADE20K mIoU of 55.6%, and COCO box AP of 56.4%), demonstrating better performance and higher speed than the recent powerful competitors. 2) We discover large kernels are the key to unlocking the exceptional performance of ConvNets in domains where they were originally not proficient.

They, however, typi-cally still require backpropagating gradients throughout the model, meaning that their training-time and -memory cost does not reduce as significantly. We propose an adaptation method which does not back-propagate gradients through the backbone. We achieve this by designing a lightweight network in parallel that oper-ates on features from the frozen, pretrained backbone. As a result, our method is efficient not only in terms of parame-ters, but also in training-time and memory usage. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-parameter trade-offs on the popular VTAB benchmark, and we further show how we outperform prior works with respect to training-time and -memory usage too. We further demonstrate the training efficiency and scalability of our method by adapting a vision transformer backbone of 4 billion parameters for the computationally demanding task of video classifi-cation, without any intricate model parallelism.

In this paper, we build affine equivariant networks based on differential invariants from the viewpoint of symmetric PDEs, without discretizing or sampling the group. To ad-dress the division-by-zero issue arising from fractional dif-ferential invariants of the affine group, we construct a new kind of affine invariants by normalizing polynomial relative differential invariants to replace classical differential invariants. For further flexibility, we design an equivariant layer, which can be directly integrated into convolutional networks of various architectures.

{"title": "PeLK: Parameter-Efficient Large Kernel ConvNets with Peripheral Convolution", "abstract": "Recently, some large kernel convnets strike back with appealing performance and efficiency. However, given the square complexity of convolution, scaling up kernels can bring about an enormous amount of parameters and the proliferated parameters can induce severe optimization problem. Due to these issues, current CNNs compromise to scale up to 51 × 51 in the form of stripe convolution (i.e., 51 ×5 + 5 ×51) and start to saturate as the kernel size continues growing. In this paper, we delve into addressing these vital issues and explore whether we can continue scaling up kernels for more performance gains. Inspired by human vision, we propose a human-like peripheral convolution that efficiently reduces over 90% parameter count of dense grid convolution through parameter sharing, and manage to scale up kernel size to extremely large.

Such a separate evaluation process induces the gap between importance and sparsity score distributions, thus causing high search costs for VTC. In this work, for the first time, we investigate how to integrate the evaluations of importance and sparsity scores into a single stage, searching the optimal subnets in an effi-cient manner. Specifically, we present OFB, a cost-efficient approach that simultaneously evaluates both importance and sparsity scores, termed Once for Both (OFB), for VTC. First, a bi-mask scheme is developed by entangling the importance score and the differentiable sparsity score to jointly deter-mine the pruning potential (prunability) of each unit. Such a bi-mask search strategy is further used together with a proposed adaptive one-hot loss to realize the progressive-and-efficient search for the most important subnet. Finally, Progressive Masked Image Modeling (PMIM) is proposed to regularize the feature space to be more representative during the search process, which may be degraded by the dimension reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OFB can achieve superior compression performance over state-of-the-art searching-based and pruning-based methods under various Vision Transformer architectures, meanwhile pro-moting search efficiency significantly, e.g., costing one GPU search day for the compression of DeiT-S on ImageNet-1K.", "keywords": "Dimensionality reduction, Computer vision, Image coding, Costs, Costing, Graphics processing units, Computer architecture", "authors": "Hancheng Ye, Chong Yu, Peng Ye, Renqiu Xia, Yansong Tang, Jiwen Lu, Tao Chen, Bo Zhang"}

DetCLIPv3 is characterized by three core designs: 1. Versatile model architecture: we derive a robust open-set detection framework which is further empowered with generation ability via the integration of a caption head. 2.

Despite the practical success, the mechanisms behind SAM's generalization enhancements remain elusive, limiting its progress in deep learning optimization. In this work, we investigate SAM's core components for generalization improvement and introduce “Friendly-SAM” (F-SAM) to further enhance SAM's generalization. Our investigation reveals the key role of batch-specific stochastic gradient noise within the adversarial perturbation, i.e., the current minibatcli gradient, which significantly influences SAM's generalization performance. By decomposing the adversarial perturbation in SAM into full gradient and stochastic gradient noise components, we discover that relying solely on the full gradient component degrades generalization while excluding it leads to improved performance. The possible reason lies in the full gradient component's increase in sharpness loss for the entire dataset, creating inconsistencies with the subsequent sharpness minimization step solely on the current minibatcli data. Inspired by these insights, F-SAM aims to mitigate the negative effects of the full gradient component. It removes the full gradient estimated by an exponentially moving average (EMA) of historical stochastic gradients, and then leverages stochastic gradient noise for improved generalization. Moreover, we provide theoretical validation for the EMA approximation and prove the convergence of F-SAM on non-convex problems.

It not only helps embody the search space but also provides a (relative) estimation of the final performance of candidate architectures. Thus, it is critical that the top architectures ranked by a supernet should be consistent with those ranked by true performance, which is known as the order-preserving ability. In this work, we analyze the order-preserving ability on the whole search space (global) and a sub-space of top architectures (local), and empirically show that the local order-preserving for current two-stage NAS methods still need to be improved. To rectify this, we propose a novel concept of Supernet Shifting, a refined search strategy combining architecture searching with supernet fine-tuning. Specifically, apart from evaluating, the training loss is also accumulated in searching and the supernet is updated every iteration. Since superior architectures are sampled more frequently in evolutionary searching, the supernet is encouraged to focus on top architectures, thus improving local order-preserving. Besides, a pre-trained supernet is often un-reusable for one-shot methods. We show that Supernet Shifting can fulfill transferring supernet to a new dataset. Specifically, the last classifier layer will be unset and trained through evolutionary searching. Comprehensive experiments show that our method has better order-preserving ability and can find a dominating architecture. Moreover, the pre-trained supernet can be easily transferred into a new dataset with no loss of performance.", "keywords": "Training, Computer vision, Estimation, Computer architecture, Search problems, Boosting, Pattern recognition", "authors": "Beichen Zhang, Xiaoxing Wang, Xiaohan Qin, Junchi Yan"}

For example, ConvNeXt-T has similar FLOPs with ResNet-50 but only achieves ~60% throughputs when trained on A100 GPUs with full precision. Although reducing the kernel size of ConvNeXt can improve speed, it results in significant performance degradation, which poses a challenging problem: How to speed up large-kernel-based CNN models while preserving their performance. To tackle this issue, inspired by Inceptions, we propose to decompose large-kernel depth-wise convolution into four parallel branches along channel dimension, i.e., small square kernel, two orthogonal band kernels, and an identity mapping. With this new Inception depthwise convolution, we build a series of networks, namely IncepitonNeXt, which not only enjoy high throughputs but also maintain competitive performance. For instance, InceptionNeXt-T achieves 1.6 × higher training throughputs than ConvNeX-T, as well as attains 0.2% top-1 accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K.

Thus, the mismatch between the forward and backward models corrupts the direction of the gradient causing training inconsistency problems and performance degradation. In contrast to current BNN approaches, we propose to employ a binary periodic (BiPer) function during binarization.

We demonstrate that this approach can control the quantization error by using the frequency of the periodic function and improves network performance.

A&B BNN is proposed to directly remove part of the multiplication operations in a traditional BNN and replace the rest with an equal number of bit operations, introducing the mask layer and the quantized RPReLU structure based on the normalizer-free network architecture. The mask layer can be removed during inference by leveraging the intrinsic characteristics of BNN with straightforward mathematical transformations to avoid the associated multiplication operations. The quantized RPReLU structure enables more efficient bit operations by constraining its slope to be integer powers of 2. Experimental results achieved 92.30%, 69.35%, and 66.89% on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets, respectively, which are competitive with the state-of-the-art.

{"title": "Neural Clustering Based Visual Representation Learning", "abstract": "We investigate a fundamental aspect of machine vision: the measurement of features, by revisiting clustering, one of the most classic approaches in machine learning and data analysis. Existing visual feature extractors, including ConvNets, ViTs, and MLPs, represent an image as rectangular regions. Though prevalent, such a grid-style paradigm is built upon engineering practice and lacks explicit modeling of data distribution. In this work, we propose feature extraction with clustering (FEC), a conceptually elegant yet surprisingly ad-hoc interpretable neural clustering framework, which views feature extraction as a process of selecting representatives from data and thus automatically captures the underlying data distribution. Given an image, FEC alternates between grouping pixels into individual clusters to abstract representatives and updating the deep features of pixels with current representatives. Such an iterative working mechanism is implemented in the form of several neural layers and the final representatives can be used for downstream tasks. The cluster assignments across layers, which can be viewed and inspected by humans, make the forward process of FEC fully transparent and empower it with promising ad-hoc interpretability. Extensive experiments on various visual recognition models and tasks verify the effectiveness, generality, and interpretability of FEC. We expect this work will provoke a rethink of the current de facto grid-style paradigm.", "keywords": "Representation learning, Visualization, Computer vision, Data analysis, Machine vision, Computational modeling, Feature extraction", "authors": "Guikun Chen, Xia Li, Yi Yang, Wenguan Wang"}
{"title": "Building Optimal Neural Architectures Using Interpretable Knowledge", "abstract": "Neural Architecture Search is a costly practice. The fact that a search space can span a vast number of design choices with each architecture evaluation taking nontrivial overhead makes it hard for an algorithm to sufficiently explore candidate networks. In this paper, we propose Auto-Build, a scheme which learns to align the latent embeddings of operations and architecture modules with the ground-truth performance of the architectures they appear in. By doing so, AutoBuild is capable of assigning interpretable importance scores to architecture modules, such as individual operation features and larger macro operation sequences such that high-performance neural networks can be constructed without any need for search. Through experiments performed on state-of-the-art image classification, segmentation, and Stable Diffusion models, we show that by mining a relatively small set of evaluated architectures, AutoBuild can learn to build high-quality architectures directly or help to reduce search space to focus on relevant areas, finding better architectures that outperform both the original labeled ones and ones found by search baselines.

Existing acceleration algorithms simplify the sampling by skipping most steps yet exhibit considerable performance degradation. By viewing the generation of diffusion models as a discretized integral process, we argue that the quality drop is partly caused by applying an inaccurate integral direction to a timestep interval. To rectify this issue, we propose a timestep tuner that helps find a more accurate integral direction for a particular interval at the minimum cost. Specifically, at each denoising step, we replace the original parameterization by conditioning the network on a new timestep, enforcing the sampling distribution towards the real one. Extensive experiments show that our plug-in design can be trained efficiently and boost the inference performance of various state-of-the-art acceleration methods, especially when there are few denoising steps. For example, when using 10 denoising steps on LSUN Bedroom dataset, we improve the FID of DDIM from 9.65 to 6.07, simply by adopting our method for a more appropriate set of timesteps.

A key component in our network is a new multi-level graph convolution network for capturing rich geometric structural features at various scales from local to global. These features are then integrated into the invertible neural network which bijectively maps the latent space, to guide the noise disentanglement process. Additionally, we employ an invertible mono-tone operator to model the transformation process, effectively enhancing the representation of integrated geometric features.

{"title": "GLACE: Global Local Accelerated Coordinate Encoding", "abstract": "Scene coordinate regression (SCR) methods are a family of visual localization methods that directly regress 2D-3D matches for camera pose estimation. They are effective in small-scale scenes but face significant challenges in large-scale scenes that are further amplified in the absence of ground truth 3D point clouds for supervision. Here, the model can only rely on reprojection constraints and needs to implicitly triangulate the points. The challenges stem from a fundamental dilemma: The network has to be invariant to observations of the same landmark at different viewpoints and lighting conditions, etc., but at the same time discriminate unrelated but similar observations. The latter becomes more relevant and severe in larger scenes. In this work, we tackle this problem by introducing the concept of co-visibility to the network. We propose GLACE, which integrates pre-trained global and local encodings and enables SCR to scale to large scenes with only a single small-sized network. Specifically, we propose a novel feature diffusion technique that implicitly groups the reprojection constraints with co-visibility and avoids overfitting to trivial solutions. Additionally, our position decoder parameterizes the output positions for large-scale scenes more effectively. Without using 3D models or depth maps for supervision, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on large-scale scenes with a low-map-size model.

We investigate the training dynamics of the classifier by applying SVD to the weights motivated by the observation that freezing weights results in constant singular values. We find that there are differences when training in IID and non-IID settings. Based on this finding, we introduce two regularization terms for local training to continuously emulate IID settings: (1) variance in the dimension-wise probability distribution of the classifier and (2) hyperspherical uniformity of representations of the encoder. These regularizations promote local models to act as if it were in an IID setting regardless of the local data distribution, thus off-setting proneness to bias while being flexible to the data.

Although some recent works focused on the differentiation of details and artifacts, this is a very challenging problem and a satisfactory solution is yet to be found. This paper shows that the characterization of genuine HF details versus artifacts can be better learned by training GAN-based SR models using wavelet-domain loss functions compared to RGB-domain or Fourier-space losses. Although wavelet-domain losses have been used in the literature before, they have not been used in the context of the SR task. More specifically, we train the discriminator only on the HF wavelet sub-bands instead of on RGB images and the generator is trained by a fidelity loss over wavelet subbands to make it sensitive to the scale and orientation of structures. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves better perception-distortion trade-off according to multiple objective measures and visual evaluations.", "keywords": "Training, Visualization, Computer vision, Inverse problems, Computational modeling, Superresolution, Hafnium", "authors": "Cansu Korkmaz, A.

{"title": "IReNe: Instant Recoloring of Neural Radiance Fields", "abstract": "Advances in NERFs have allowed for 3D scene reconstructions and novel view synthesis. Yet, efficiently editing these representations while retaining photo realism is an emerging challenge. Recent methods face three primary limitations: they're slow for interactive use, lack precision at object boundaries, and struggle to ensure multi-view consistency. We introduce IReNe to address these limitations, enabling swift, near real-time color editing in NeRF. Leveraging a pre-trained NeRF model and a single training image with user-applied color edits, IReNe swiftly adjusts network parameters in seconds. This adjustment allows the model to generate new scene views, accurately representing the color changes from the training image while also controlling object boundaries and view-specific effects. Object boundary control is achieved by integrating a trainable segmentation module into the model. The process gains efficiency by retraining only the weights of the last network layer. We observed that neurons in this layer can be classified into those responsible for view-dependent appearance and those contributing to diffuse appearance. We introduce an automated classification approach to identify these neuron types and exclusively fine-tune the weights of the diffuse neurons. This further accelerates training and ensures consistent color edits across different views. A thorough validation on a new dataset, with edited object colors, shows significant quantitative and qualitative advancements over competitors, accelerating speeds by 5x to 500x.", "keywords": "Training, Image segmentation, Three-dimensional displays, Image color analysis, Neurons, Neural radiance field, Real-time systems", "authors": "Alessio Mazzucchelli, Adrian Garcia-Garcia, Elena Garces, Fernando Rivas-Manzaneque, Francesc Moreno-Noguer, Adrian Penate-Sanchez"}
{"title": "AdaShift: Learning Discriminative Self-Gated Neural Feature Activation With an Adaptive Shift Factor", "abstract": "Nonlinearities are decisive in neural representation learning. Traditional Activation (Act) functions im-pose fixed inductive biases on neural networks with ori-ented biological intuitions. Recent methods leverage self-gated curves to compensate for the rigid traditional Act paradigms in fitting flexibility. However, substantial improvements are still impeded by the norm-induced mis-matched feature recalibrations (see Section 1), i.e., the actual importance of a feature can be inconsistent with its explicit intensity such that violates the basic intention of a direct self-gated feature re-weighting. To address this problem, we propose to learn discriminative neural feature Act with a novel prototype, namely, AdaShift, which en-hances typical self-gated Act by incorporating an adaptive shift factor into the re-weighting function of Act. AdaShift casts dynamic translations on the inputs of are-weighting function by exploiting comprehensive feature-filter context cues of different ranges in a simple yet effective manner. We obtain the new intuitions of AdaShift by rethinking the feature-filter relationships from a common Softmax-based classification and by generalizing the new observations to a common learning layer that encodes features with updatable filters. Our practical AdaShifts, built upon the new Act prototype, demonstrate significant improvements to the popular/SOTA Act functions on different vision benchmarks. By simply replacing ReLU with AdaShifts, ResNets can match advanced Transformer counterparts (e.g., ResNet-50 vs. Swin-T) with lower cost andfewer parameters.", "keywords": "Representation learning, Computer vision, Filters, Costs, Neural networks, Fitting, Prototypes", "authors": "Sudong Cai"}
{"title": "Kernel Adaptive Convolution for Scene Text Detection via Distance Map Prediction", "abstract": "Segmentation-based scene text detection algorithms that are accurate to the pixel level can satisfy the detection of arbitrary shape scene text and have received widespread attention. On the one hand, due to the complexity and di-versity of the scene text, the convolution with a fixed kernel size has some limitations in extracting the visual features of the scene text. On the other hand, most of the existing segmentation-based algorithms only segment the center of the text, losing information such as the edges and directions of the text, with limited detection accuracy. There are also some improved algorithms that use iterative cor-rections or introduce other multiple information to improve text detection accuracy but at the expense of efficiency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a simple and effective scene text detection method, the Kernel Adaptive Con-volution, which is designed with a Kernel Adaptive Con-volution Module for scene text detection via predicting the distance map. Specifically, first, we design an extensible kernel adaptive convolution module (KACM) to extract vi-sual features from multiple convolutions with different ker-nel sizes in an adaptive manner. Secondly, our method pre-dicts the text distance map under the supervision of a pri-ori information (including direction map, and foreground segmentation map) and completes the text detection from the predicted distance map. Experiments on four publicly available datasets prove the effectiveness of our algorithm, in which the accuracy and efficiency of both the Total- Text and TD500 outperform the state-of-the-art algorithm.

However, the accuracy and robustness resulting from the adversarial training are limited by the architecture, because adversarial training improves accuracy and robustness by adjusting the weight connection affiliated to the architecture. In this work, we propose ARNAS to search for accurate and robust architectures for adversarial training. First we design an accurate and robust search space, in which the placement of the cells and the proportional relationship of the filter numbers are care-fully determined. With the design, the architectures can obtain both accuracy and robustness by deploying accurate and robust structures to their sensitive positions, re-spectively. Then we propose a differentiable multi-objective search strategy, performing gradient descent towards directions that are beneficial for both natural loss and adversar-ial loss, thus the accuracy and robustness can be guaran-teed at the same time. We conduct comprehensive experiments in terms of white-box attacks, black-box attacks, and transferability. Experimental results show that the searched architecture has the strongest robustness with the compet-itive accuracy, and breaks the traditional idea that NAS-based architectures cannot transfer well to complex tasks in robustness scenarios. By analyzing outstanding architectures searched, we also conclude that accurate and robust neural architectures tend to deploy different structures near the input and output, which has great practical significance on both hand-crafting and automatically designing of accurate and robust architectures.", "keywords": "Training, Computer vision, Accuracy, Closed box, Computer architecture, Search problems, Robustness", "authors": "Yuwei Ou, Yuqi Feng, Yanan Sun"}

In this line of research, existing methods typically follow an inversion-and-distillation paradigm in which a generative adversarial network on-the-fly trained with the guidance of the pre-trained teacher network is used to synthesize a large-scale sample set for knowledge distillation. In this paper, we reexam-ine this common data-free knowledge distillation paradigm, showing that there is considerable room to improve the overall training efficiency through a lens of “small-scale inverted data for knowledge distillation”. In light of three empirical observations indicating the importance of how to balance class distributions in terms of synthetic sample di-versity and difficulty during both data inversion and distillation processes, we propose Small Scale Data-free Knowledge Distillation (SSD-KD). Informulation, SSD-KD introduces a modulating function to balance synthetic samples and a priority sampling function to select proper samples, facilitated by a dynamic replay buffer and a reinforcement learning strategy. As a result, SSD-KD can perform dis-tillation training conditioned on an extremely small scale of synthetic samples (e.g., 10x less than the original training data scale), making the overall training efficiency one or two orders of magnitude faster than many mainstream methods while retaining superior or competitive model performance, as demonstrated on popular image classification and semantic segmentation benchmarks.

{"title": "OrthCaps: An Orthogonal CapsNet with Sparse Attention Routing and Pruning", "abstract": "Redundancy is a persistent challenge in Capsule Networks (CapsNet), leading to high computational costs and parameter counts. Although previous studies have introduced pruning after the initial capsule layer, dynamic routing's fully connected nature and non-orthogonal weight matrices reintroduce redundancy in deeper layers. Besides, dynamic routing requires iterating to converge, further increasing computational demands. In this paper, we propose an Orthogonal Capsule Network (OrthCaps) to reduce redundancy, improve routing performance and decrease parameter counts. Firstly, an efficient pruned capsule layer is introduced to discard redundant capsules. Secondly, dynamic routing is replaced with orthogonal sparse attention routing, eliminating the need for iterations and fully connected structures. Lastly, weight matrices during routing are orthogonalized to sustain low capsule similarity, which is the first approach to use Householder orthogonal decomposition to enforce orthogonality in CapsNet. Our experiments on baseline datasets affirm the efficiency and robustness of OrthCaps in classification tasks, in which ablation studies validate the criticality of each component.

ViTs capture the global information of images through self attention modules, which perform dot product computations among patchified image tokens. While self-attention modules empower ViTs to capture long-range dependencies, the computational complexity grows quadratically with the number of tokens, which is a major hindrance to the practical application of ViTs. Moreover, the self-attention mechanism in deep ViTs is also susceptible to the attention saturation issue. Accordingly, we argue against the necessity of computing the attention scores in every layer, and we propose the Less-Attention Vision Transformer (LaViT), which computes only a few attention operations at each stage and calculates the subsequent feature alignments in other layers via attention transformations that leverage the previously calculated attention scores. This novel approach can mitigate two primary issues plaguing traditional self attention modules: the heavy computational burden and attention saturation.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework, DiffPerformer, to synthesize high-fidelity and temporally consistent human video. Without complex architecture modification or costly training, DiffPerformer finetunes a pre-trained diffusion model on a single video of the target character and introduces an implicit video representation as a proxy to learn temporally consistent guidance for the diffusion model. The guidance is encoded into VAE latent space and an iterative optimization loop is constructed between the implicit video representation and the diffusion model, allowing to harness the smooth property of the implicit video representation and the generative capabilities of the diffusion model in a mutually beneficial way. Moreover, we propose 3D-aware human flow as a temporal constraint during the optimization to explicitly model the correspondence between driving poses and human appearance. This alleviates the mis-alignment between driving poses and target performer and therefore maintains the appearance coherence under various motions.

Well-controlling interactions in generated images could yield meaningful applications, such as creating realistic scenes with interacting characters.

{"title": "Cache Me if You Can: Accelerating Diffusion Models through Block Caching", "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently revolutionized the field of image synthesis due to their ability to generate photorealistic images. However, one of the major drawbacks of diffusion models is that the image generation process is costly. A large image-to-image network has to be applied many times to iteratively refine an image from random noise. While many recent works propose techniques to reduce the number of required steps, they generally treat the underlying denoising network as a black box. In this work, we investigate the behavior of the layers within the network and find that 1) the layers' output changes smoothly over time, 2) the layers show distinct patterns of change, and 3) the change from step to step is often very small. We hypothesize that many layer computations in the denoising network are redundant. Leveraging this, we introduce block caching, in which we reuse outputs from layer blocks of previous steps to speed up inference. Furthermore, we propose a technique to automatically determine caching schedules based on each block's changes over timesteps. In our experiments, we show through FID, human evaluation and qualitative analysis that Block Caching allows to generate images with higher visual quality at the same computational cost.

However, they struggle to handle complex scenarios with curvilinear motions since they overlook the latent acceleration information between the input frames. Moreover, the supervision of predicted motions is tricky because ground-truth motions are not available. To this end, we propose a novel frame-work for implicit quadratic video frame interpolation (IQ-VFI), which explores latent acceleration information and accurate intermediate motions via knowledge distillation. Specifically, the proposed IQ-VFI consists of an implicit acceleration estimation network (IANet) and a VFI back-bone, the former fully leverages spatio-temporal information to explore latent acceleration priors between two input frames, which is then used to progressively modulate linear motions from the latter into quadratic motions in coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, to encourage both components to distill more acceleration and motion cues oriented towards VFI, we propose a knowledge distillation strategy in which implicit acceleration distillation loss and implicit motion distillation loss are employed to adaptively guide latent acceleration priors and intermediate motions learning, respectively. Extensive experiments show that our proposed IQ-VFI can achieve state-of-the-art performances on various benchmark datasets.", "keywords": "Interpolation, Computer vision, Accuracy, Motion estimation, Computational modeling, Estimation, Benchmark testing", "authors": "Mengshun Hu, Kui Jiang, Zhihang Zhong, Zheng Wang, Yinqiang Zheng"}
{"title": "Coarse-to-Fine Latent Diffusion for Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis", "abstract": "Diffusion model is a promising approach to image generation and has been employed for Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS) with competitive performance. While existing methods simply align the person appearance to the target pose, they are prone to overfitting due to the lack of a high-level semantic understanding on the source person image. In this paper, we propose a novel Coarse-to-Fine Latent Diffusion (CFLD) method for PGPIS. In the absence of image-caption pairs and textual prompts, we de-velop a novel training paradigm purely based on images to control the generation process of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. A perception-refined decoder is designed to progressively refine a set of learnable queries and extract semantic understanding of person images as a coarse-grained prompt. This allows for the decoupling of fine-grained appearance and pose information controls at different stages, and thus circumventing the potential over-fitting problem. To generate more realistic texture details, a hybrid- granularity attention module is proposed to encode multi-scale fine-grained appearance features as bias terms to augment the coarse-grained prompt. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results on the DeepFashion benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state of the arts for PGPIS.

{"title": "MACE: Mass Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models", "abstract": "The rapid expansion of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models has raised growing concerns regarding their potential misuse in creating harmful or misleading content. In this paper, we introduce MACE, a finetuning framework for the task of MAss Concept Erasure. This task aims to prevent models from generating images that embody unwanted concepts when prompted. Existing concept erasure methods are typically restricted to handling fewer than five concepts simultaneously and struggle to find a balance between erasing concept synonyms (generality) and maintaining unrelated concepts (specificity). In contrast, MACE differs by successfully scaling the erasure scope up to 100 concepts and by achieving an effective balance between generality and specificity. This is achieved by leveraging closed-form cross-attention refinement along with LoRA finetuning, collectively eliminating the information of undesirable concepts. Furthermore, MACE integrates multiple LoRAs without mutual interference. We conduct extensive evaluations of MACE against prior methods across four different tasks: object erasure, celebrity erasure, explicit content erasure, and artistic style erasure. Our results reveal that MACE surpasses prior methods in all evaluated tasks.

Despite the dominance of Transformer architectures in various fields due to their flexibility and scalability, the visual generative domain primarily utilizes CNN-based U-Net architectures, particularly in diffusion-based models. We introduce GenTron, a family of Generative models employing Transformer-based diffusion, to address this gap. Our initial step was to adapt Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) from class to text conditioning, a process involving thorough empirical exploration of the conditioning mechanism. We then scale GenTron from approximately 900M to over 3B parameters, observing improvements in visual quality. Furthermore, we extend GenTron to text-to-video generation, incorporating novel motion-free guidance to enhance video quality. In human evaluations against SDXL, GenTron achieves a 51.1% win rate in visual quality (with a 19.8% draw rate), and a 42.3% win rate in text alignment (with a 42.9% draw rate). GenTron notably performs well in T2I-CompBench, highlighting its compositional generation ability.

However, their reliance on web-scale data of varied quality often yields results that are visually unappealing and misaligned with the textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we propose InstructVideo to instruct text-to-video diffusion models with human feedback by reward fine-tuning. InstructVideo has two key ingredients: 1) To ameliorate the cost of reward fine-tuning induced by generating through the full DDIM sampling chain, we recast reward fine-tuning as editing. By leveraging the diffusion process to corrupt a sampled video, InstructVideo requires only partial inference of the DDIM sampling chain, reducing fine-tuning cost while improving fine-tuning efficiency. 2) To mitigate the absence of a dedicated video reward model for human preferences, we repurpose established image reward models, e.g., HPSv2. To this end, we propose Segmental Video Reward, a mechanism to provide reward signals based on segmental sparse sampling, and Temporally Attenuated Reward, a method that mitigates temporal modeling degradation during fine-tuning.

Utilizing a precise object mask can greatly enhance these applications. However, due to the challenges users encounter in creating high-fidelity masks, there is a tendency for these methods to rely on more coarse masks (e.g., bounding box) for these applications. This results in limited control and compromised background content preservation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SmartMask, which allows any novice user to create detailed masks for precise object insertion. Combined with a ControlNet-Inpaint model, our experiments demonstrate that SmartMask achieves superior object insertion quality, preserving the background content more effectively than previous methods. Notably, unlike prior works the proposed approach can also be used even without user-mask guid-ance, which allows it to perform mask-free object insertion at diverse positions and scales. Furthermore, we find that when used iteratively with a novel instruction-tuning based planning model, SmartMask can be used to design detailed layouts from scratch.

While recent advancements in text-to-3D generation have shown promise, they often fall short in rendering detailed and high-quality 3D models. This problem is especially prevalent as many methods base themselves on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). This paper identifies a notable deficiency in SDS, that it brings inconsistent and low-quality updating direction for the 3D model, causing the over-smoothing effect. To address this, we propose a novel approach called Interval Score Matching (ISM).

To overcome these challenges, we propose HyperDreamBooth—a hypernetwork capable of efficiently generating a small set of personalized weights from a single image of a person. By composing these weights into the diffusion model, coupled with fast finetuning, HyperDreamBooth can generate a person's face in various contexts and styles, with high subject details while also preserving the model's crucial knowledge of diverse styles and semantic modifications.

It encodes both spatial and temporal motion relations on the dense surface manifold of a statistical body template, which inherits body topology priors for generalizable novel view synthesis with sparse training observations. 2) Physical motion decoding that is designed to encourage physical motion learning by decoding the motion triplane features at timestep t to pre-dict both spatial derivatives and temporal derivatives at the next timestep t + 1 in the training stage. 3) 4D appearance decoding that renders the motion trip lanes into images by an efficient volumetric surface-conditioned renderer that fo-cuses on the rendering of body surfaces with motion learning conditioning.

{"title": "A Recipe for Scaling up Text-to-Video Generation with Text-free Videos", "abstract": "Diffusion-based text-to-video generation has witnessed impressive progress in the past year yet still falls behind text-to-image generation. One of the key reasons is the limited scale of publicly available data (e.g., 10M video-text pairs in WebVid10m vs. 5B image-text pairs in LAION), considering the high cost of video captioning. Instead, it could be far easier to collect unlabeled clips from video platforms like YouTube. Motivated by this, we come up with a novel text-to-video generation framework, termed TF-T2V, which can directly learn with text-free videos. The rationale behind is to separate the process of text decoding from that of temporal modeling. To this end, we employ a content branch and a motion branch, which are jointly optimized with weights shared. Following such a pipeline, we study the effect of doubling the scale of training set (i.e., video-only WebVid10M) with some randomly collected text-free videos and are encouraged to observe the performance improvement (FID from 9.67 to 8.19 and FVD from 484 to 441), demonstrating the scalability of our approach. We also find that our model could enjoy sustainable performance gain (FID from 8.19 to 7.64 and FVD from 441 to 366) after reintroducing some text labels for training.

The diffusion model is applied to recover the low-frequency component only, which presents general information of the original image but 1/16 in size. To preserve the original identity, the generation is conditioned on the low-frequency component of low-quality images at each denoising step. Meanwhile, high-frequency components at multiple decomposition levels are handled by a unified network, which recovers complex facial details in a single step.

One of the key reasons is that current methods intertwine spatial content and temporal dynamics together, leading to a notably increased complexity of text-to-video generation (T2V). In this work, we propose HiGen, a diffusion model-based method that improves performance by decoupling the spatial and temporal factors of videos from two perspectives, i.e., structure level and content level. At the structure level, we decompose the T2V task into two steps, including spatial reasoning and temporal reasoning, using a unified denoiser. Specifically, we generate spatially coherent priors using text during spatial reasoning and then generate temporally coherent motions from these priors during temporal reasoning. At the content level, we extract two subtle cues from the content of the input video that can express motion and appearance changes, respectively. These two cues then guide the model's training for generating videos, enabling flexible content variations and enhancing temporal stability. Through the decoupled paradigm, HiGen can effectively reduce the complexity of this task and generate realistic videos with semantics accuracy and motion stability.

We find that depth-conditioned diffusion models inherently possess the capability to generate 3D consistent views by requesting a grid of images instead of single views. Based on these insights, we introduce a multi-view reference sheet of modified images. Our method updates an image collection consistently based on the ref-erence sheet and refines the original NeRF with the newly generated image set in one go.

However, merely using text prompts is not enough to depict the desired subject appearance that accurately aligns with users' intents, especially for customized content creation. In this paper, we study the task of video generation with image prompts, which provide more accurate and direct content control beyond the text prompts. Specifically, we propose a feed-forward framework VideoBooth, with two dedicated designs: 1) We propose to embed image prompts in a coarse-to-fine manner. Coarse visual embeddings from image encoder provide high-level encodings of image prompts, while fine visual embeddings from the proposed attention injection module provide multi-scale and detailed encoding of image prompts. These two complementary embeddings can faithfully capture the desired appearance. 2) In the attention injection module at fine level, multi-scale image prompts are fed into different cross-frame attention layers as additional keys and values. This extra spatial in-formation refines the details in the first frame and then it is propagated to the remaining frames, which maintains temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Video Booth achieves state-of-the-art performance in gener-ating customized high-quality videos with subjects specified in image prompts.

In contrast, we present DragNoise, offering ro-bust and accelerated editing without retracing the latent map. The core rationale of DragNoise lies in utilizing the predicted noise output of each U-Net as a semantic editor. This approach is grounded in two critical observations: firstly, the bottleneck features of U-Net inherently possess semantically rich features ideal for interactive editing; secondly, high-level semantics, established early in the denoising process, show minimal variation in subsequent stages. Leveraging these insights, DragNoise edits diffusion semantics in a sin-gle denoising step and efficiently propagates these changes, ensuring stability and efficiency in diffusion editing.

We do this by engineering special sets of input tokens that can be transformed in a continuous manner – we call them Continuous 3D Words. These attributes can, for example, be represented as sliders and applied jointly with text prompts for fine-grained control over image generation. Given only a single mesh and a rendering engine, we show that our approach can be adopted to provide continuous user control over several 3D-aware attributes, including time-of-day illumination, bird wing orientation, dollyzoom effect, and object poses.

To tackle this issue, we present CHAIN (lipsCHitz continuity constrAIned Normalization), which replaces the conventional centering step with zero-mean regularization and integrates a Lips-chitz continuity constraint in the scaling step.

While recent methods for view synthesis based on diffusion have shown great progress, achieving consistency among various view estimates and at the same time abiding by the desired camera pose remains a critical problem yet to be solved. In this work, we demonstrate a strikingly simple method, where we utilize a pre-trained video diffusion model to solve this problem. Our key idea is that synthesizing a novel view could be reformulated as synthesizing a video of a cam-era going around the object of interest-a scanning video-which then allows us to leverage the powerful priors that a video diffusion model would have learned. Thus, to perform novel-view synthesis, we create a smooth camera trajectory to the target view that we wish to render, and denoise using both a view-conditioned diffusion model and a video diffusion model.

{"title": "Prompting Hard or Hardly Prompting: Prompt Inversion for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models", "abstract": "The quality of the prompts provided to text-to-image diffusion models determines how faithful the generated content is to the user's intent, often requiring 'prompt engineering ‘. To harness visual concepts from target images without prompt engineering, current approaches largely rely on embedding inversion by optimizing and then mapping them to pseudo-tokens. However, working with such highdimensional vector representations is challenging because they lack semantics and interpretability, and only allow simple vector operations when using them. Instead, this work focuses on inverting the diffusion model to obtain interpretable language prompts directly. The challenge of doing this lies in the fact that the resulting optimization problem is fundamentally discrete and the space of prompts is exponentially large; this makes using standard optimization techniques, such as stochastic gradient descent, difficult. To this end, we utilize a delayed projection scheme to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space in the model. Further, we leverage the findings that different timesteps of the diffusion process cater to different levels of detail in an image. The later, noisy, timesteps of the forward diffusion process correspond to the semantic information, and therefore, prompt inversion in this range provides tokens representative of the image semantics. We show that our approach can identify semantically interpretable and meaningful prompts for a target image which can be used to synthesize diverse images with similar content.

In this work, we introduce SceneWiz3D - a novel approach to synthesize high-fidelity 3D scenes from text. We marry the locality of objects with globality of scenes by introducing a hybrid 3D representation - explicit for objects and implicit for scenes. Remarkably, an object, being represented explicitly, can be either generated from text using conventional text-to-3D approaches, or provided by users. To configure the layout of the scene and automatically place objects, we apply the Particle Swarm Optimization technique during the optimization process. Furthermore, it is difficult for certain parts of the scene (e.g., corners, occlusion) to receive multi-view supervision, leading to inferior geometry.

To address the above issues, we propose FreeDrag, a feature dragging methodology designed to free the burden on point tracking. The Free-Drag incorporates two key designs, i.e., template feature via adaptive updating and line search with backtracking, the former improves the stability against drastic content change by elaborately controlling the feature updating scale after each dragging, while the latter alleviates the misguidance from similar points by actively restricting the search area in a line.

Specifically, we adopt dual denoising paths to represent content/style references in latent space and then guide the content image denoising process with style latent codes. We further reveal that the cross-attention mechanism in latent diffusion models tends to blend the content and style images, resulting in stylized outputs that deviate from the original content image. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a cross-attention reweighting strategy.

{"title": "Tackling the Singularities at the Endpoints of Time Intervals in Diffusion Models", "abstract": "Most diffusion models assume that the reverse process adheres to a Gaussian distribution. However, this approxi-mation has not been rigorously validated, especially at sin-gularities, where t = 0 and t = 1. Improperly dealing with such singularities leads to an average brightness is-sue in applications, and limits the generation of images with extreme brightness or darkness. We primarily focus on tackling singularities from both theoretical and practi-cal perspectives. Initially, we establish the error bounds for the reverse process approximation, and showcase its Gaussian characteristics at singularity time steps. Based on this theoretical insight, we confirm the singularity at t = 1 is conditionally removable while it at t = 0 is an inherent property. Upon these significant conclusions, we propose a novel plug-and-play method SingDiffusion to address the initial singular time step sampling, which not only effectively resolves the average brightness issue for a wide range of diffusion models without extra training efforts, but also enhances their generation capability in achieving notable lower FID scores.", "keywords": "Training, Computer vision, Brightness, Gaussian distribution, Diffusion models, Pattern recognition", "authors": "Pengze Zhang, Hubery Yin, Chen Li, Xiaohua Xie"}

At the heart of CosmicMan's success are the new reflections and perspectives on data and models: (1) We found that data quality and a scalable data production flow are essential for the final results from trained models. Hence, we propose a new data production paradigm, Annotate Anyone, which serves as a perpetual data flywheel to produce high-quality data with accurate yet cost-effective annotations over time. Based on this, we constructed a large-scale dataset, CosmicMan-HQ 1.0, with 6 Million high-quality real-world human images in a mean resolution of \n<tex xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">$1488 \\times 1255$</tex>\n, and attached with precise text annotations deriving from 115 Million attributes in diverse granularities. (2) We argue that a text-to-image foundation model specialized for humans must be pragmatic – easy to integrate into down-streaming tasks while effective in producing high-quality human images. Hence, we propose to model the relationship between dense text descriptions and image pixels in a decomposed manner, and present Decomposed-Attention-Refocusing (Daring) training framework. It seamlessly decomposes the cross-attention features in existing text-to-image diffusion model, and enforces attention refocusing without adding extra modules.

While diffusion models have been successful, their computational inten-sity has prompted the pursuit of more efficient alternatives.

However, a major drawback of these models is their in-ferior performance compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we aim to re-evaluate the full potential of NATs by revisiting the design of their training and inference strategies.

It aims to synthesize images of a specific person wearing a specified garment. Diffusion model-based approaches have recently become popular, as they are excellent at image synthesis tasks. However, these approaches usually employ additional image encoders and rely on the cross-attention mechanism for texture transfer from the garment to the person image, which affects the try-on's efficiency and fidelity. To address these issues, we propose an Texture-Preserving Diffusion (TPD) model for virtual try-on, which enhances the fidelity of the results and introduces no additional image encoders. Accordingly, we make contributions from two aspects. First, we propose to concatenate the masked person and reference garment images along the spatial dimension and utilize the resulting image as the input for the diffusion model's denoising UNet. This enables the original self-attention layers contained in the diffusion model to achieve efficient and accurate texture transfer.

In addition, we integrate mask prediction and image synthesis into a single compact model.

{"title": "PromptCoT: Align Prompt Distribution via Adapted Chain-of-Thought", "abstract": "Diffusion-based generative models have exhibited remarkable capability in the production of high-fidelity visual content such as images and videos. However, their performance is significantly contingent upon the quality of textual inputs, commonly referred to as ‘'prompts'. The process of traditional prompt engineering necessitates empirical exper-tise and poses challenges for inexperienced users. In this paper, we introduce PromptCoT, an innovative enhancer that autonomously refines prompts for users. PromptCoT is designed based on the observation that prompts, which re-semble the textual information of high-quality images during training, lead to superior generation performance. Therefore, we fine-tune the Large Language Models (LLM) using a curated text dataset that comprises descriptions of high-quality visual content. Consequently, the LLM can capture the distribution of high-quality texts, enabling it to boost the original texts. Nonetheless, one drawback of LLMs is their tendency to generate irrelevant information. We employ a tailored Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism to address the problem. Our CoT can extract and amalgamate crucial information from the prompt candidates, enabling a reasonable process based on the contextual cues to produce a more comprehensive and nuanced output. Considering computational efficiency, instead of allocating a dedicated LLM to each individual model or dataset, we integrate adapters that facil-itate task-specific adaptation, leveraging a shared LLM as the foundation for this process. With independent fine-tuning of adapters, we can adapt PromptCoT to new datasets while minimally increasing training costs and memory usage. We evaluate the effectiveness of PromptCoT by assessing on widely-used latent diffusion models for visual generation.

However,naïvely implementing such an algorithm breaks the interaction between patches and loses fidelity, while incorporating such an interaction will incur tremendous communication overhead. To overcome this dilemma, we observe the high similarity between the input from adjacent diffusion steps and propose displaced patch parallelism, which takes advantage of the sequential nature of the diffusion process by reusing the pre-computed feature maps from the previous timestep to provide context for the current step. Therefore, our method supports asynchronous commu-nication, which can be pipelined by computation. Extensive experiments show that our method can be applied to recent Stable Diffusion XL with no quality degradation and achieve up to a 6.1 ×speedup on eight A100 GPUs compared to one.", "keywords": "Degradation, Computer vision, Computational modeling, Graphics processing units, Diffusion processes, Parallel processing, Diffusion models", "authors": "Muyang Li, Tianle Cai, Jiaxin Cao, Qinsheng Zhang, Han Cai, Junjie Bai, Yangqing Jia, Kai Li, Song Han"}

Typical works focus on learning the new subject's private attributes. However, an important fact has not been taken seriously that a subject is not an isolated new concept but should be a specialization of a certain category in the pre-trained model. This results in the subject failing to comprehensively inherit the attributes in its category, causing poor attribute-related generations. In this paper, motivated by object-oriented programming, we model the subject as a derived class whose base class is its semantic category. This modeling enables the subject to inherit public attributes from its category while learning its private attributes from the user-provided example. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play method, Subject-Derived regularization (SuDe). It constructs the base-derived class modeling by constraining the subject-driven generated images to semantically belong to the subject's category. Extensive experiments under three baselines and two backbones on various subjects show that our SuDe enables imaginative attribute-related generations while maintaining subject fidelity.

GAN inversion is a crucial step that seeks the latent code to reconstruct input images or videos, subsequently enabling diverse editing tasks through manipulation of this latent code.

We address this issue by explicitly modeling OOD objects from the input in 3D-aware GANs. Our core idea is to represent the image using two individual neural radiance fields: one for the in-distribution content and the other for the out-of-distribution object. The final reconstruction is achieved by optimizing the composition of these two radiance fields with carefully designed regularization. We demonstrate that our explicit decomposition alleviates the inherent tradeoff between reconstruction fidelity and editability.

While existing models focus on minimizing a weighted sum of denoising score matching losses for data distribution modeling, their training primarily emphasizes instance-level optimization, over-looking valuable structural information within each mini-batch, indicative of pair-wise relationships among samples. To address this limitation, we introduce Structure-guided Adversarial training of Diffusion Models (SADM). In this pioneering approach, we compel the model to learn manifold structures between samples in each training batch. To ensure the model captures authentic manifold structures in the data distribution, we advocate adversarial training of the diffusion generator against a novel structure discriminator in a minimax game, distinguishing real manifold structures from the generated ones.

{"title": "Learning Adaptive Spatial Coherent Correlations for Speech-Preserving Facial Expression Manipulation", "abstract": "Speech-preserving facial expression manipulation (SPFEM) aims to modify facial emotions while meticulously maintaining the mouth animation associated with spoken content. Current works depend on inaccessible paired training samples for the person, where two aligned frames exhibit the same speech content yet differ in emotional expression, limiting the SPFEM applications in real-world scenarios. In this work, we discover that speak-ers who convey the same content with different emotions exhibit highly correlated local facial animations, providing valuable supervision for SPFEM. To capitalize on this insight, we propose a novel adaptive spatial coherent correlation learning (ASCCL) algorithm, which models the aforementioned correlation as an explicit metric and integrates the metric to supervise manipulating facial expression and meanwhile better preserving the facial animation of spoken contents. To this end, it first learns a spatial coherent correlation metric, ensuring the visual disparities of adjacent local regions of the image belonging to one emotion are similar to those of the corresponding counterpart of the image belonging to another emotion. Recognizing that visual disparities are not uniform across all regions, we have also crafted a disparity-aware adaptive strategy that prioritizes regions that present greater challenges. During SPFEM model training, we construct the adaptive spatial coherent correlation metric between corresponding local regions of the input and output images as addition loss to supervise the generation process. We conduct extensive experiments on variant datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ASCCL algorithm.

We first quantify the FVD’ s sensitivity to the temporal axis by decoupling the frame and motion quality and find that the FVD increases only slightly with large temporal corruption. We then analyze the generated videos and show that via careful sampling from a large set of generated videos that do not contain motions, one can drastically decrease FVD without improving the temporal quality. Both studies suggest FVD's bias towards the quality of individual frames. We further observe that the bias can be attributed to the features extracted from a supervised video classifier trained on the content-biased dataset. We show that FVD with features extracted from the recent large-scale self-supervised video models is less biased toward image quality.

Many existing research works, which train models using the low-quality WebVid-10M dataset, struggle to generate high-quality videos because the models are optimized to fit WebVid-10M.

We first analyze the connection between the spatial and temporal modules of video models and the distribution shift to low-quality videos. We observe that full training of all modules results in a stronger coupling between spatial and temporal modules than only training temporal modules. Based on this stronger coupling, we shift the distribution to higher quality without motion degradation by finetuning spatial modules with high-quality images, resulting in a generic high-quality video model.

{"title": "Neural Implicit Morphing of Face Images", "abstract": "Face morphing is a problem in computer graphics with numerous artistic and forensic applications. It is challenging due to variations in pose, lighting, gender, and ethnicity. This task consists of a warping for feature alignment and a blending for a seamless transition between the warped images. We propose to leverage coord-based neural networks to represent such warpings and blendings of face images. During training, we exploit the smoothness and flexibility of such networks by combining energy functionals employed in classical approaches without discretizations. Additionally, our method is time-dependent, allowing a continuous warping/blending of the images. During morphing inference, we need both direct and inverse transformations of the time-dependent warping. The first (second) is responsible for warping the target (source) image into the source (target) image. Our neural warping stores those maps in a single network dismissing the need for inverting them. The results of our experiments indicate that our method is competitive with both classical and generative models under the lens of image quality and face-morphing detectors.

This is due to an inconsistency: while denoising starts from pure Gaus-sian noise during inference, the training noise schedule retains residual data even in the final timestep distribution, due to difficulties in numerical conditioning in main-stream formulation, leading to unintended bias during in-ference. To mitigate this issue, certain ∊-prediction mod-els are combined with an ad-hoc offset-noise methodology. In parallel, some contemporary models have adopted zero-terminal SNR noise schedules together with v -prediction, which necessitate major alterations to pre-trained models. However, such changes risk destabilizing a large multitude of community-driven applications anchored on these pre-trained models. In light of this, our investigation revisits the fundamental causes, leading to our proposal of an inno-vative and principled remedy, called One More Step (OMS).

Efficient Post-training Quantization (PTQ) is pivotal for addressing these issues in traditional models. Different from traditional models, diffusion models heavily depend on the time-step t to achieve satisfactory multi-round denoising. Usually, t from the finite set {1, …, T} is encoded to a temporal feature by a few modules totally irrespective of the sampling data. However, existing PTQ methods do not optimize these modules separately. They adopt inappropriate reconstruction targets and complex calibration methods, resulting in a severe disturbance of the temporal feature and denoising trajectory, as well as a low compression efficiency. To solve these, we propose a Temporal Feature Maintenance Quantization (TFMQ) framework building upon a Temporal Information Block which is just related to the time-step t and unrelated to the sampling data. Powered by the pioneering block design, we devise temporal information aware reconstruction (TIAR) and finite set calibration (FSC) to align the full-precision temporal features in a limited time.

They operate through a two-steps process: introducing noise into training samples and then employing a model to convert random noise into new samples (e.g., images).

It is unclear, however, how these models behave at scale, as more synthetic data is added to the training set. In this paper we study the scaling laws of synthetic images generated by state of the art text-to-image models, for the training of supervised models: image classifiers with label supervision, and CLIP with language super-vision. We identify several factors, including text prompts, classifier-free guidance scale, and types of text-to-image models, that significantly affect scaling behavior. After tuning these factors, we observe that synthetic images demon-strate a scaling trend similar to, but slightly less effective than, real images in CLIP training, while they significantly underperform in scaling when training supervised image classifiers. Our analysis indicates that the main reason for this underperformance is the inability of off-the-shelf text-to-image models to generate certain concepts, a limitation that significantly impairs the training of image classifiers. Our findings also suggest that scaling synthetic data can be particularly effective in scenarios such as: (1) when there is a limited supply of real images for a supervised problem (e.g., fewer than 0.5 million images in ImageNet), (2) when the evaluation dataset diverges significantly from the training data, indicating the out-of-distribution scenario, or (3) when synthetic data is used in conjunction with real images, as demonstrated in the training of CLIP models.", "keywords": "Training, Computational modeling, Machine vision, Text to image, Training data, Market research, Data models", "authors": "Lijie Fan, Kaifeng Chen, Dilip Krishnan, Dina Katabi, Phillip Isola, Yonglong Tian"}

Now text-to-image foundation models are widely applied to various down-stream image synthesis tasks, such as controllable image generation and image editing, while downstream video synthesis tasks are less explored for several reasons. First, it requires huge memory and computation overhead to train a video generation foundation model. Even with video foundation models, additional costly training is still required for downstream video synthesis tasks. Second, although some works extend image diffusion models into videos in a training-free manner, temporal consistency cannot be well preserved. Finally, these adaption methods are specifically designed for one task and fail to generalize to different tasks. To mitigate these issues, we propose a training-free general-purpose video synthesis framework, coined as BIVDiff, via bridging specific image diffusion models and general text-to-video foundation diffusion models. Specifically, we first use a specific image diffusion model (e.g., ControlNet and Instruct Pix2Pix) for frame-wise video generation, then perform Mixed Inversion on the generated video, and finally input the inverted latents into the video diffusion models (e.g., VidRD and ZeroScope) for temporal smoothing. This decoupled framework enables flexible image model selection for different purposes with strong task generalization and high efficiency.

Specifically, the RDP objective is a supervised regression objective that tasks the diffusion model with predicting the reward difference of generated image pairs from their denoising trajectories. We theoretically prove that the diffusion model that obtains perfect reward difference prediction is exactly the maximizer of the RL objective. We further develop an online algorithm with proximal updates to stably optimize the RDP objective. In experiments, we demonstrate that PRDP can match the reward maximization ability of well-established RL-based methods in small-scale training. Furthermore, through large-scale training on text prompts from the Human Preference Dataset v2 and the Pick-a-Pic v1 dataset, PRDP achieves superior generation quality on a diverse set of complex, unseen prompts whereas RL-based methods completely fail.", "keywords": "Training, Technological innovation, Closed box, Reinforcement learning, Diffusion models, Rendering (computer graphics), Prediction algorithms", "authors": "Fei Deng, Qifei Wang, Wei Wei, Tingbo Hou, Matthias Grundmann"}

Existing solutions involve cross-attention manipulation for better compositional understanding or integrating large language models for improved layout planning. However, the inherent alignment capabilities of T2I models are still inadequate. By reviewing the link between generative and discriminative modeling, we posit that T2I models' discriminative abilities may reflect their text-image alignment proficiency during generation. In this light, we advocate bolstering the discriminative abilities of T2I models to achieve more precise text-to-image alignment for generation. We present a discriminative adapter built on T2I models to probe their discriminative abilities on two representative tasks and leverage discriminative fine-tuning to improve their text-image alignment. As a bonus of the discriminative adapter, a self-correction mechanism can leverage discriminative gradients to better align generated images to text prompts during inference. Comprehensive evaluations across three benchmark datasets, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, demonstrate our method's superior generation performance.

We introduce Trailer Generation Transformer (TGT), a deep-learning framework utilizing an encoder-decoder architecture. TGT movie encoder is tasked with contextualizing each movie shot representation via self-attention, while the autoregressive trailer de-coder predicts the feature representation of the next trailer shot, accounting for the relevance of shots' temporal order in trailers.

In this work, we propose a novel approach to enhance temporal consistency in generated videos by merging self-attention tokens across frames. By aligning and compressing temporally redundant tokens across frames, our method improves temporal coherence and reduces memory consumption in self-attention computations. The merging strategy matches and aligns tokens according to the temporal correspondence between frames, facilitating natural temporal consistency in generated video frames.

Conventional diffusion-based methods for scene text generation are typically limited by their reliance on an intermediate layout output. This dependency often results in a constrained diversity of text styles and fonts, an inherent limitation stemming from the deterministic nature of the layout generation phase. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Scene TextGen, a novel diffusion-based model specifically designed to circumvent the need for a predefined layout stage. By doing so, Scene-TextGen facilitates a more natural and varied representation of text. The novelty of SceneTextGen lies in its integration of three key components: a character-level encoder for capturing detailed typographic properties, coupled with a character-level instance segmentation model and a word-level spotting model to address the issues of unwanted text generation and minor character inaccuracies.

The core of our RStab framework lies in Stabilized Rendering (SR), a volume rendering module, fusing multi-frame information in 3D space. Specifically, SR involves warping features and colors from multiple frames by projection, fusing them into descriptors to render the stabilized image. However, the precision of warped information depends on the projection accuracy, a factor significantly influenced by dynamic regions. In response, we introduce the Adaptive Ray Range (ARR) module to integrate depth priors, adaptively defining the sampling range for the projection process.

Smooth latent spaces en-sure that a perturbation on an input latent corresponds to a steady change in the output image. This property proves beneficial in downstream tasks, including image interpolation, inversion, and editing. In this work, we expose the non-smoothness of diffusion latent spaces by observing noticeable visual fluctuations resulting from minor latent variations. To tackle this issue, we propose Smooth Diffusion, a new category of diffusion models that can be simultaneously high-performing and smooth. Specifically, we introduce Step-wise Variation Regularization to enforce the proportion between the variations of an arbitrary input latent and that of the output image is a constant at any diffusion training step. In addition, we devise an interpolation standard deviation (ISTD) metric to effectively assess the latent space smoothness of a diffusion model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Smooth Diffusion stands out as a more desirable solution not only in T2I generation but also across various downstream tasks.

To achieve non-invasive, precise, customizable, and transferable elimination, we ground our erasing framework on one-dimensional adapters to erase multiple concepts from most DMs at once across versatile erasing applications. The concept-SemiPermeable structure is injected as a Membrane (SPM) into any DM to learn targeted erasing, and mean-time the alteration and erosion phenomenon is effectively mitigated via a novel Latent Anchoring fine-tuning strategy.

This makes it very efficient during training and unlocks end-to-end optimization on high-resolution videos. We improve PDMs in two principled ways. First, to enforce consistency between patches, we develop deep context fusion — an architectural technique that propagates the context information from low-scale to high-scale patches in a hierarchical manner.

Most existing methods tackle this problem by synthesizing pseudo ground truths (PGTs). However, the generated PGTs are often sub-optimal and their imprecision will eventually lead to performance degradation. To alleviate this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Content-Style Decoupled Makeup Transfer (CSD-MT) method, which works in a purely unsupervised manner and thus eliminates the negative effects of generating PGTs. Specifically, based on the frequency characteristics analysis, we assume that the low-frequency (LF) component of a face image is more associated with its makeup style information, while the high-frequency (HF) component is more related to its content details. This assumption allows CSD-MT to decouple the content and makeup style information in each face image through the frequency decomposition. After that, CSD-MT realizes makeup transfer by maximizing the consistency of these two types of information between the transferred result and input images, respectively. Two newly designed loss functions are also introduced to further improve the transfer performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses show the effectiveness of our CSD-MT method.

Instead, learning to compress semantic features within VQ tokenizers significantly improves generative transformers' ability to capture textures and structures. We thus highlight two competing objectives of VQ tokeniz-ers for image synthesis: semantic compression and details preservation. Different from previous work that pri-oritizes better details preservation, we propose Semantic-Quantized GAN (SeQ-GAN) with two learning phases to balance the two objectives.

We address these issues point by point. First, we find the variance-based cost volume exhibits failure patterns as the features of pixels corresponding to the same point can be inconsistent across different views due to occlusions or reflections. We introduce an Adaptive Cost Aggregation (ACA) approach to amplify the contribution of consistent pixel pairs and suppress inconsistent ones.

{"title": "High-fidelity Person-centric Subject-to-Image Synthesis", "abstract": "Current subject-driven image generation methods en-counter significant challenges in person-centric image generation. The reason is that they learn the semantic scene and person generation by fine-tuning a common pre-trained diffusion, which involves an irreconcilable training imbalance. Precisely, to generate realistic persons, they need to sufficiently tune the pre-trained model, which inevitably causes the model to forget the rich semantic scene prior and makes scene generation over-fit to the training data. Moreover, even with sufficient fine-tuning, these methods can still not generate high-fidelity persons since joint learning of the scene and person generation also lead to quality compromise. In this paper, we propose Face-diffuser, an effective collaborative generation pipeline to eliminate the above training imbal-ance and quality compromise. Specifically, we first develop two specialized pre-trained diffusion models, i.e., Text-driven Diffusion Model (TDM) and Subject-augmented Diffusion Model (SDM), for scene and person generation, respectively. The sampling process is divided into three sequential stages, i.e., semantic scene construction, subject-scene fusion, and subject enhancement. The first and last stages are performed by TDM and SDM respectively. The subject-scene fusion stage, that is the collaboration achieved through a novel and highly effective mechanism, Saliency-adaptive Noise Fusion (SNF). Specifically, it is based on our key observation that there exists a robust link between classifier-free guidance responses and the saliency of generated images. In each time step, SNF leverages the unique strengths of each model and allows for the spatial blending of predicted noises from both models automatically in a saliency-aware manner, all of which can be seamlessly integrated into the DDIM sampling process. Extensive experiments confirm the impressive effectiveness and robustness of the Face-diffuser in gener-ating high-fidelity person images depicting multiple unseen persons with varying contexts.

{"title": "Relation Rectification in Diffusion Model", "abstract": "Despite their exceptional generative abilities, large T2I diffusion models, much like skilled but careless artists, often struggle with accurately depicting visual relationships between objects. This issue, as we uncover through careful analysis, arises from a misaligned text encoder that struggles to interpret specific relationships and differentiate the logical order of associated objects. To resolve this, we in-troduce a novel task termed Relation Rectification, aiming to refine the model to accurately represent a given relationship it initially fails to generate. To address this, we propose an innovative solution utilizing a Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (HGCN). It models the di-rectional relationships between relation terms and corre-sponding objects within the input prompts. Specifically, we optimize the HGCN on a pair of prompts with identical relational words but reversed object orders, supplemented by a few reference images. The lightweight HGCN adjusts the text embeddings generated by the text encoder, ensuring accurate reflection of the textual relation in the em-bedding space. Crucially, our method retains the parameters of the text encoder and diffusion model, preserving the model's robust performance on unrelated descriptions.

As the name implies, LeftRefill horizontally stitches reference and target views together as a whole input. The reference image occupies the left side, while the target canvas is positioned on the right. Then, LeftRefill paints the rightside target canvas based on the left-side reference and specific task instructions. Such a task formulation shares some similarities with contextual inpainting, akin to the actions of a human painter. This novel formulation efficiently learns both structural and textured correspondence between reference and target without other image encoders or adapters. We inject task and view information through cross-attention modules in T2I models, and further exhibit multi-view reference ability via the re-arranged self-attention modules. These enable LeftRefill to perform consistent generation as a generalized model without requiring testtime fine-tuning or model modifications. Thus, LeftRefill can be seen as a simple yet unified framework to address reference-guided synthesis.

Most existing methods are CNN-based and estimate optical flow from the source image to the current driving frame, which is then inpainted and refined to produce the output animation. We propose a transformer-based encoder for computing a set-latent representation of the source image(s). We then predict the output color of a query pixel using a transformer-based decoder, which is conditioned with keypoints and a facial expression vector extracted from the driving frame. Latent representations of the source person are learned in a self-supervised manner that factorize their appearance, head pose, and facial expressions. Thus, they are perfectly suited for cross-reenactment. In contrast to most related work, our method naturally extends to multiple source images and can thus adapt to person-specific facial dynamics. We also propose data augmentation and regularization schemes that are necessary to prevent overfitting and support generalizability of the learned representations.

In this paper, we present PIA, a Personalized Image Animator that excels in aligning with condition images, achieving motion controllability by text, and the compatibility with various personalized T2I models without specific tuning. To achieve these goals, PIA builds upon a base T2I model with well-trained temporal alignment layers, allowing for the seamless transformation of any personalized T2I model into an image animation model. A key component of PIA is the introduction of the condition module, which takes as inputs the conditionframe and inter-frame affinity. This module leverages the affinity hint to transfer appearance information from the condition frame to individual frames in the latent space. This design mitigates the challenges of appearance-related frame alignment within PIA and allows for a stronger focus on aligning with motion-related guidance.

Existing studies effectively address this problem by learning a discrete codebook from scratch and in a code-independent manner to quantize continuous representations into discrete tokens. However, learning a codebook from scratch and in a code-independent manner is highly challenging, which may be a key reason causing codebook collapse, i.e., some code vectors can rarely be optimized without regard to the relationship between codes and good codebook priors such that die off finally. In this paper, inspired by pretrained language models, we find that these language models have actually pretrained a superior codebook via a large number of text corpus, but such information is rarely exploited in VQIM. To this end, we propose a novel codebook transfer framework with part-of-speech, called VQCT, which aims to transfer a well-trained codebook from pretrained language models to VQIM for robust codebook learning. Specifically, we first introduce a pretrained codebook from language models and part-of-speech knowledge as priors. Then, we construct a vision-related codebook with these priors for achieving codebook transfer. Finally, a novel codebook transfer network is designed to exploit abundant semantic relationships between codes contained in pretrained codebooks for robust VQIM codebook learning.

However, these numerical methods inherently result in certain approximation errors, which significantly degrades sample quality with extremely small NFE (e.g., around 5). In contrast, based on the geometric observation that each sampling trajectory almost lies in a two-dimensional subspace embedded in the ambient space, we propose Approximate MEan-Direction Solver (AMED-Solver) that eliminates truncation errors by directly learning the mean direction for fast diffusion sampling.

We explore deformation-aware face stylization that diverges from traditional single-image style reference, opting for a real-style image pair instead. The cornerstone of our method is the utilization of a self-supervised vision transformer, specifically DINO-ViT, to establish a robust and consistent facial structure representation across both real and style domains. Our stylization process begins by adapting the StyleGAN generator to be deformation-aware through the integration of spatial transformers (STN). We then introduce two innovative constraints for generator fine-tuning under the guidance of DINO semantics: i) a directional deformation loss that regulates directional vectors in DINO space, and ii) a relative structural consistency constraint based on DINO token self-similarities, ensuring diverse generation. Additionally, style-mixing is employed to align the color generation with the reference, minimizing inconsistent correspondences. This framework delivers enhanced deformability for general one-shot face stylization, achieving notable efficiency with a fine-tuning duration of approximately 10 minutes.

To overcome the preference for low-level features and the entanglement of high-level features, we propose an inversion-based method Action-Disentangled Identifier (ADI) to learn action-specific identifiers from the exemplar images. ADI first expands the semantic conditioning space by introducing layer-wise identifier tokens, thereby increasing the representational richness while distributing the inversion across different features. Then, to block the inversion of action-agnostic features, ADI extracts the gradient invariance from the constructed sample triples and masks the updates of irrelevant channels. To comprehensively evaluate the task, we present an Action-Bench that includes a variety of actions, each accompanied by meticulously selected samples.

In response to this limitation, we present a novel image-free distillation scheme named SwiftBrush. Drawing inspiration from text-to-3D synthesis, in which a 3D neural radiance field that aligns with the input prompt can be obtained from a 2D text-to-image diffusion prior via a specialized loss without the use of any 3D data ground-truth, our approach re-purposes that same loss for distilling a pretrained multi-step text-to-image model to a student network that can generate high-fidelity images with just a single inference step.

However, for domain-specific scenarios, tuning-free Text-guided Image Editing (TIE) is of greater importance for application developers.

Nevertheless, little is known about the semantic meanings that these attention layers have learned and which parts of the attention maps contribute to the success of image editing. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth probing analysis and demonstrate that cross-attention maps in Stable Diffusion often contain object attribution information, which can result in editing failures. In contrast, self-attention maps play a crucial role in preserving the geometric and shape details of the source image during the transformation to the target image.

{"title": "DiffMorpher: Unleashing the Capability of Diffusion Models for Image Morphing", "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable image generation quality surpassing previous generative models. However, a notable limitation of diffusion models, in comparison to GANs, is their difficulty in smoothly interpolating between two image samples, due to their highly unstructured latent space. Such a smooth interpolation is intriguing as it naturally serves as a solution for the image mor-phing task with many applications. In this work, we address this limitation via DiffMorpher, an approach that enables smooth and natural image interpolation by harnessing the prior knowledge of a pretrained diffusion model. Our key idea is to capture the semantics of the two images by fitting two LoRAs to them respectively, and interpolate between both the LoRA parameters and the latent noises to ensure a smooth semantic transition, where correspon-dence automatically emerges without the need for annotation. In addition, we propose an attention interpolation and injection technique, an adaptive normalization adjustment method, and a new sampling schedule to further enhance the smoothness between consecutive images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffMorpher achieves starkly better image morphing effects than previous methods across a variety of object categories, bridging a critical functional gap that distinguished diffusion models from GANs.", "keywords": "Interpolation, Schedules, Image synthesis, Semantics, Image morphing, Noise, Fitting", "authors": "Kaiwen Zhang, Yifan Zhou, Xudong Xu, Bo Dai, Xingang Pan"}
{"title": "StegoGAN: Leveraging Steganography for Non-Bijective Image-to-Image Translation", "abstract": "Most image-to-image translation models postulate that a unique correspondence exists between the semantic classes of the source and target domains. However, this assumption does not always hold in real-world scenarios due to divergent distributions, different class sets, and asymmet- rical information representation. As conventional GANs attempt to generate images that match the distribution of the target domain, they may hallucinate spurious instances of classes absent from the source domain, thereby dimin- ishing the usefulness and reliability of translated images. CycleGAN-based methods are also known to hide the mis- matched information in the generated images to bypass cy- cle consistency objectives, a process known as steganogra- phy. In response to the challenge of non-bijective image translation, we introduce StegoGAN, a novel model that leverages steganography to prevent spurious features in generated images. Our approach enhances the semantic consistency of the translated images without requiring ad- ditional postprocessing or supervision. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that StegoGAN outperforms existing GAN-based models across various non-bijective image- to-image translation tasks, both qualitatively and quantita- tively.

Our approach is underpinned by two contributions: Field Latents, a latent representation encoding textures as discrete vector fields on the mesh vertices, and Field Latent Diffusion Models, which learn to denoise a diffusion process in the learned latent space on the surface. We consider a single-textured-mesh paradigm, where our models are trained to generate variations of a given texture on a mesh. We show the synthesized textures are of superior fidelity compared those from existing single-textured-mesh generative models. Our models can also be adapted for user-controlled editing tasks such as inpainting and label-guided generation. The efficacy of our approach is due in part to the equivariance of our proposed framework under isometries, allowing our models to seamlessly reproduce details across locally similar regions and opening the door to a notion of generative texture transfer.

While existing methods facilitate high-fidelity customization for individual concepts or a limited, pre-defined set of them, they fall short of achieving scalability, where a single model can seamlessly render countless concepts. In this paper, we address a new problem called Modular Customization, with the goal of efficiently merging customized models that were fine-tuned independently for individual concepts. This allows the merged model to Jointly synthesize concepts in one image without compromising fidelity or incurring any additional computational costs. To address this problem, we introduce Orthogonal Adaptation, a method designed to encourage the customized models, which do not have access to each other during fine-tuning, to have orthogonal residual weights. This ensures that during inference time, the customized models can be summed with minimal interference. Our proposed method is both simple and versatile, applicable to nearly all optimizable weights in the model architecture.

It is still challenging to synthesize an image that aligns well with the input text, and multiple runs with carefully crafted prompts are required to achieve satisfactory results. To mitigate these limitations, numerous studies have endeavored to fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion models, i.e., UNet, utilizing various technologies. Yet, amidst these efforts, a pivotal question of text-to-image diffusion model training has remained largely unexplored: Is it possible and feasible to fine-tune the text encoder to improve the performance of text-to-image diffusion models? Our findings reveal that, instead of replacing the CLIP text encoder used in Stable Diffusion with other large language models, we can enhance it through our proposed fine-tuning approach, TextCraftor, leading to substantial improvements in quantitative benchmarks and human assessments.

For example, text-to-image models and their 3D-aware variants are trained on internet-scale image datasets and can be used to produce scenes with realistic appearance and 3D structure—but no motion. Text-to-video models are trained on relatively smaller video datasets and can produce scenes with motion, but poorer appearance and 3D structure. While these models have complementary strengths, they also have opposing weaknesses, making it difficult to combine them in a way that alleviates this three-way tradeoff. Here, we introduce hybrid score distillation sampling, an alternating optimization procedure that blends supervision signals from multiple pre-trained diffusion models and incorporates benefits of each for high-fidelity text-to-4D generation.

{"title": "Image Neural Field Diffusion Models", "abstract": "Diffusion models have shown an impressive ability to model complex data distributions, with several key advantages over GANs, such as stable training, better coverage of the training distribution's modes, and the ability to solve inverse problems without extra training. However, most diffusion models learn the distribution of fixed-resolution images. We propose to learn the distribution of continuous images by training diffusion models on image neural fields, which can be rendered at any resolution, and show its advantages over fixed-resolution models. To achieve this, a key challenge is to obtain a latent space that represents photorealistic image neural fields. We propose a simple and effective method, inspired by several recent techniques but with key changes to make the image neural fields photo-realistic. Our method can be used to convert existing latent diffusion autoencoders into image neural field autoen-coders.

Although recent work attempts to learn these preferences via human annotated images, they reduce the rich tapestry of human preference to a single overall score.

Therefore, to learn the multidimensional human preferences, we propose the Multi-dimensional Preference Score (MPS), the first multidimensional preference scoring model for the evaluation of text-to-image models. The MPS introduces the preference condition module upon CLIP model to learn these diverse preferences.

It involves instance sampling, feature representation, and decision-making. However, existing MIL-based technologies at least suffer from one or more of the following problems: 1) requiring high storage and intensive preprocessing for numerous instances (sampling); 2) potential over-fitting with limited knowledge to predict bag labels (feature representation); 3) pseudo-bag counts and prior biases affect model robustness and generalizability (decision-making). Inspired by clinical diagnostics, using the past sampling instances can facili-tate the final WSI analysis, but it is barely explored in prior technologies. To break free these limitations, we integrate the dynamic instance sampling and reinforcement learning into a unified framework to improve the instance selection and feature aggregation, forming a novel Dynamic Policy Instance Selection (DPIS) scheme for better and more cred-ible decision-making. Specifically, the measurement of feature distance and reward function are employed to boost continuous instance sampling. To alleviate the over-fitting, we explore the latent global relations among instances for more robust and discriminative feature representation while establishing reward and punishment mechanisms to correct biases in pseudo-bags using contrastive learning. These strategies form the final Dynamic Policy-Driven Adaptive Multi-Instance Learning (PAMIL) method for WSI tasks.

Despite the meaningful semantics gen-eration, the existing arts suffer from the semantic discrep-ancy between the masked and unmasked regions, since the semantically dense unmasked texture fails to be completely degraded while the masked regions turn to the pure noise in diffusion process, leading to the large discrepancy between them. In this paper, we aim to answer how the unmasked se-mantics guide the texture denoising process; together with how to tackle the semantic discrepancy, to facilitate the con-sistent and meaningful semantics generation. To this end, we propose a novel structure-guided diffusion model for image inpainting named StrDiffusion, to reformulate the conventional texture denoising process under the structure guidance to derive a simplified denoising objective for im-age inpainting, while revealing: 1) the semantically sparse structure is beneficial to tackle the semantic discrepancy in the early stage, while the dense texture generates the rea-sonable semantics in the late stage; 2) the semantics from the unmasked regions essentially offer the time-dependent structure guidance for the texture denoising process, ben-efiting from the time-dependent sparsity of the structure semantics. For the denoising process, a structure-guided neural network is trained to estimate the simplified denoising objective by exploiting the consistency of the denoised structure between masked and unmasked regions. Besides, we devise an adaptive resampling strategy as aformal criterion as whether the structure is competent to guide the texture denoising process, while regulate their semantic corre-lations.

Given a target video, these two fields are jointly optimized to reconstruct it through a carefully tailored rendering pipeline. We advisedly introduce some regularizations into the optimization process, urging the canonical content field to inherit semantics (e.g., the object shape) from the video. With such a design, CoDeF naturally supports lifting image algorithms for video processing, in the sense that one can apply an image algorithm to the canonical image and effortlessly propagate the outcomes to the entire video with the aid of the temporal deformation field. We experimentally show that CoDeF is able to lift image-to-image translation to video-to-video translation and lift keypoint detection to keypoint tracking without any training. More importantly, thanks to our lifting strategy that deploys the algorithms on only one image, we achieve superior cross-frame consistency in processed videos compared to existing video-to-video translation approaches, and even manage to track non-rigid objects like water and smog.

In this work, we aim to expand the applicability of the pre-trained diffusion model so that it can be utilized independently for the virtual try-on task. The main challenge is to preserve the clothing details while effectively utilizing the robust generative capability of the pre-trained model. In order to tackle these issues, we propose StableVITON, learning the semantic correspon-dence between the clothing and the human body within the latent space of the pre-trained diffusion model in an end-to-end manner. Our proposed zero cross-attention blocks not only preserve the clothing details by learning the semantic correspondence but also generate high-fidelity images by utilizing the inherent knowledge of the pre-trained model in the warping process. Through our proposed novel attention total variation loss and applying augmentation, we achieve the sharp attention map, resulting in a more precise representation of clothing details.

How-ever, the advancement of video-to-video (V2V) synthesis has been hampered by the challenge of maintaining temporal consistency across video frames. This paper proposes a consistent V2V synthesis framework by jointly leveraging spatial conditions and temporal optical flow clues within the source video. Contrary to prior methods that strictly adhere to optical flow, our approach harnesses its benefits while handling the imperfection in flow estimation. We encode the optical flow via warping from the first frame and serve it as a supplementary reference in the diffusion model. This enables our model for video synthesis by editing the first frame with any prevalent I2I models and then propagating edits to successive frames. Our V2V model, Flow Vid, demon-strates remarkable properties: (1) Flexibility: Flow Vid works seamlessly with existing I2I models, facilitating various modifications, including stylization, object swaps, and local edits.

In contrast to LLMs, human preference learning has not been widely explored in text-to-image diffusion models; the best existing approach is to fine-tune a pretrained model using carefully curated high quality images and captions to improve visual appeal and text alignment. We propose Diffusion-DPO, a method to align diffusion models to human preferences by directly optimizing on human comparison data. Diffusion-DPO is adapted from the recently developed Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) [36], a simpler alternative to RLHF which directly optimizes a policy that best satisfies human preferences under a classification objective. We re-formulate DPO to account for a diffusion model notion of likelihood, utilizing the evidence lower bound to derive a differentiable objective.

This task presents two challenges: (1) high-resolution CC images lack the captions necessary to train T2I models; (2) CC images are relatively scarce. To address these challenges, we use an intuitive transfer learning technique to produce a set of high-quality synthetic captions paired with our assembled CC images. We then develop a data- and compute-efficient training recipe that requires as little as 3% of the LAION data (i.e., roughly 70 million examples) needed to train existing SD2 models, but obtains the same quality. These results indicate that we have a sufficient number of CC images (also roughly 70 million) for training high-quality models. Our recipe also implements a variety of optimizations that achieve 2.71 x training speed-ups, enabling rapid model iteration. We leverage this recipe to train several high-quality T2I mod-els, which we dub the CommonCanvas family.

With increased human control, it is now possible to edit an image in a plethora of ways; from specifying in text what we want to change, to straight up dragging the contents of the image in an interactive point-based manner. However, most of the focus has remained on editing single images at a time. Whether and how we can simultaneously edit large batches of images has remained understudied. With the goal ofmin-imizing human supervision in the editing process, this paper presents a novel method for interactive batch image editing using StyleGAN as the medium. Given an edit specified by users in an example image (e.g., make the face frontal), our method can automatically transfer that edit to other test images, so that regardless of their initial state (pose), they all arrive at the same final state (e.g., all facing front).

However, most approaches primarily operate in the raw pixel space of images, which limits the exploration of the frequency characteristics of underwater images, leading to an inadequate utilization of deep models' representational capabilities in producing high-quality images. In this paper, we introduce a novel Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) framework, named WF-Diff, designed to fully leverage the character-istics of frequency domain information and diffusion models.

Recent advancements in high-order numerical ODE solvers for DPMs have enabled the generation of high-quality images with much fewer sampling steps. While this is a significant development, most sampling methods still employ uniform time steps, which is not optimal when using a small number of steps. To address this issue, we propose a general framework for designing an optimization problem that seeks more appropriate time steps for a specific numerical ODE solver for DPMs. This optimization problem aims to minimize the distance between the ground-truth solution to the ODE and an approximate solution corresponding to the numerical solver. It can be efficiently solved using the constrained trust region method, taking less than 15 seconds. Our extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional sampling using pixel- and latent-space DPMs demonstrate that, when combined with the state-of-the-art sampling method UniPC, our optimized time steps significantly improve image generation performance in terms of FID scores for datasets such as CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, compared to using uniform time steps.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\nCode is available at https://github.com/scxue/DM-NonUniform", "keywords": "Computer vision, Accuracy, Image synthesis, Optimization methods, Diffusion models, Sampling methods, Pattern recognition", "authors": "Shuchen Xue, Zhaoqiang Liu, Fei Chen, Shifeng Zhang, Tianyang Hu, Enze Xie, Zhenguo Li"}

According to the principle of feature-matching learning, existing fusion-based methods usually fuse different features by using similarity measurements or attention mechanisms, which may match features inaccurately and lead to artifacts in the texture and structure of generated images. In this paper, we propose an exact Fusion via Feature Distribution matching Generative Adversarial Network (F2DGAN) for few-shot image generation. The rationale behind this is that feature distribution matching is much more reliable than feature matching to explore the statistical characters in image feature space for limited real-world data. To model feature distributions from only a few examples for feature fusion, we design a novel variational feature distribution matching fusion module to perform exact fusion by empirical cumulative distribution functions. Specifically, we employ a variational autoencoder to transform deep image features into distributions and fuse different features exactly by applying histogram matching.

Among these, a notable method is Textual Inversion, which generates personalized images by inverting given images into textual embeddings. However, methods based on Textual Inversion still struggle with balancing the tradeoff between reconstruction quality and editability. In this study, we examine this issue through the lens of initialization. Upon closely examining traditional initialization methods, we identified a significant disparity between the initial and learned embeddings in terms of both scale and orientation. The scale of the learned embedding can be up to 100 times greater than that of the initial embedding. Such a significant change in the embedding could increase the risk of overfitting, thereby compromising the editability. Driven by this observation, we introduce a novel initialization method, termed Cross Initialization, that significantly narrows the gap between the initial and learned embeddings. This method not only improves both reconstruction and editability but also reduces the optimization steps from 5,000 to 320. Furthermore, we apply a regularization term to keep the learned embedding close to the initial embedding. We show that when combined with Cross Initialization, this regularization term can effectively improve editability. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence to demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to the baseline methods. Notably, in our experiments, Cross Initialization is the only method that successfully edits an individual's facial expression.

Second, we introduce the appearance Noise Prior, a novel mechanism aimed at maintaining the capabilities of pre-trained 2D diffusion models. These design elements empower MicroCinema to generate high-quality videos with precise motion, guided by the provided text prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework. Concretely, MicroCinema achieves SOTA zero-shot FVD of 342.86 on UCF-JOJ and 377.40 on MSR-VTT.", "keywords": "Image synthesis, Noise, Pipelines, Dynamics, Text to image, Dynamic scheduling, Motion capture", "authors": "Yanhui Wang, Jianmin Bao, Wenming Weng, Ruoyu Feng, Dacheng Yin, Tao Yang, Jingxu Zhang, Qi Dai, Zhiyuan Zhao, Chunyu Wang, Kai Qiu, Yuhui Yuan, Xiaoyan Sun, Chong Luo, Baining Guo"}
{"title": "Towards Memorization-Free Diffusion Models", "abstract": "Pretrained diffusion models and their outputs are widely accessible due to their exceptional capacity for synthesizing high-quality images and their open-source nature. The users, however, may face litigation risks owing to the models' tendency to memorize and regurgitate training data during inference. To address this, we introduce Anti-Memorization Guidance (AMG), a novel framework employing three targeted guidance strategies for the main causes of memorization: image and caption duplication, and highly specific user prompts. Consequently, AMG ensures memorization-free outputs while maintaining high Image quality and text alignment, leveraging the synergy of its guidance methods, each indispensable in its own right. AMG also features an innovative automatic detection system for potential memorization during each step of inference process, allows selective application of guidance strategies, minimally interfering with the original sampling process to preserve output utility. We applied AMG to pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Stable Diffusion across various generation tasks. The results demonstrate that AMG is the first approach to successfully eradicates all instances of memorization with no or marginal impacts on image quality and text-alignment, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores.", "keywords": "Image quality, Training, Measurement, Refining, Noise reduction, Training data, Reliability theory", "authors": "Chen Chen, Daochang Liu, Chang Xu"}
{"title": "SD-DiT: Unleashing the Power of Self-Supervised Discrimination in Diffusion Transformer*", "abstract": "Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has emerged as the new trend of generative diffusion models on image generation. In view of extremely slow convergence in typical DiT, recent breakthroughs have been driven by mask strategy that significantly improves the training efficiency of DiT with additional intra-image contextual learning. Despite this progress, mask strategy still suffers from two inherent limitations: (a) training-inference discrepancy and (b) fuzzy relations between mask reconstruction & generative diffusion process, resulting in sub-optimal training of DiT. In this work, we address these limitations by novelly unleashing the self-supervised discrimination knowledge to boost DiT training. Technically, we frame our DiT in a teacher-student manner. The teacher-student discriminative pairs are built on the diffusion noises along the same Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE). Instead of applying mask reconstruction loss over both DiT encoder and decoder, we decouple DiT encoder and decoder to separately tackle discriminative and generative objectives. In particular, by encoding discriminative pairs with student and teacher DiT encoders, a new discriminative loss is designed to encourage the inter-image alignment in the selfsupervised embedding space. After that, student samples are fed into student DiT decoder to perform the typical generative diffusion task. Extensive experiments are conducted on ImageNet dataset, and our method achieves a competitive balance between training cost and generative capacity.", "keywords": "Training, Image synthesis, Noise, Diffusion processes, Ordinary differential equations, Transformers, Market research", "authors": "Rui Zhu, Yingwei Pan, Yehao Li, Ting Yao, Zhenglong Sun, Tao Mei, Chang Wen Chen"}
{"title": "Towards Effective Usage of Human-Centric Priors in Diffusion Models for Text-based Human Image Generation", "abstract": "Vanilla text-to-image diffusion models struggle with generating accurate human images, commonly resulting in imperfect anatomies such as unnatural postures or disproportionate limbs. Existing methods address this issue mostly by fine-tuning the model with extra images or adding additional control - human-centric priors such as pose or depth maps - during the image generation phase. This paper explores the integration of these human-centric priors directly into the model fine-tuning stage, essentially eliminating the need for extra conditions at the inference stage. We realize this idea by proposing a human-centric alignment loss to strengthen human-related information from the textual prompts within the cross-attention maps. To ensure semantic detail richness and human structural accuracy during fine-tuning, we introduce scale-aware and step-wise constraints within the diffusion process, according to an indepth analysis of the cross-attention layer. Extensive experiments show that our method largely improves over state-of-the-art text-to-image models to synthesize high-quality human images based on user-written prompts.

{"title": "Text2QR: Harmonizing Aesthetic Customization and Scanning Robustness for Text-Guided QR Code Generation", "abstract": "In the digital era, QR codes serve as a linchpin connecting virtual and physical realms. Their pervasive integration across various applications highlights the demand for aesthetically pleasing codes without compromised scannability. However, prevailing methods grapple with the intrinsic challenge of balancing customization and scannability. Notably, stable-diffusion models have ushered in an epoch of high-quality, customizable content generation. This paper introduces Text2QR, a pioneering approach leveraging these advancements to address a fundamental challenge: concurrently achieving user-defined aesthetics and scanning robustness. To ensure stable generation of aesthetic QR codes, we introduce the QR Aesthetic Blueprint (QAB) module, generating a blueprint image exerting control over the entire generation process. Subsequently, the Scannability Enhancing Latent Refinement (SELR) process refines the output iteratively in the latent space, enhancing scanning robustness. This approach harnesses the potent generation capabilities of stable-diffusion models, navigating the trade-off between image aesthetics and QR code scannability. Our experiments demonstrate the seamless fusion of visual appeal with the practical utility of aesthetic QR codes, markedly outperforming prior methods.
